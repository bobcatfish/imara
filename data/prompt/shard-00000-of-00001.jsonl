And, we already did nofap with sex and it didn't rid him of the innappropriate sexual thoughts.  He decided Reboot.  I did not commit to 90 days of NO AFFECTION AT ALL.  He's stopped doing those little things, just sitting on the couch, he won't sit by me, he won't reach out and touch my hand.  I'm becoming the bitchy nagging wife because I'm horny every day and I'm not even receiving any kissing or cuddles.  He said maybe I should schlick.

This is the first time in years that a non-Democratic leader with almost total power has started taking large swathes of territory and threatened to take others. (insert your stupid fucking false equivalency comparison with Iraq and Af-pak). Obviously Putin is going to take the easy pieces first,  that can be taken without a shot fired.  ended up as a welcome guest of the Kremlin. \n The thing that I notice most lately is that the Kremlin doesn't seek to justify its actions by making reference to international law and legal precedent, but instead self-justifies its actions as Russian destiny - the people speak Russian, they are Russian, therefore they belong to our empire. Putin tried to make an incredibly weak comparison to Kosovo (there was a struggle for independence from Yugo/Serbia and a legitimate conflict in Kosovo going back over 10 years, outright civil war and allegations of ethnic cleansing, and none of which happened in Crimea.) This was really just an attempt to propagandize the counterculture western audience and gin up cynicism. There is no legitimate equivalence. \n Recognize that there are dual standards - the ongoing conflict in Chechnya started with Chechens wanting to secede from Russia in 1990, however they were denied on many of the same grounds stated as rationales for Crimea. \n Putin's Russia has basically gone so rogue that I would not expect them to honor any treaties or international law (UN) here on out. Lip service only and when the rubber meets the road, not even that. They will play both ends against the middle to de-legitimize the UN and NATO, and other global cooperative organizations that they can't buffalo. \n They can always cobble up legalistic rationales for additional conquests, but the bottom line is that the Russian people will keep cheering Putin on as long as he expands the glory of the empire. He won't suffer a loss of domestic confidence or any serious political opposition as long as he controls the strings of the media. He's a healthy guy and has a lot of money, power, and extra time left to build the sort of empire that will have him remembered not just as a temporary president of a republic, but as a great man of history. Ultimately Putin will never step down from power with term limits like every American president, he's only just beginning. \n To put it bluntly, he's living out the advice attributed anonymously to Karl Rove in 2004: \"We're an empire now, and when we act, we create our own reality. And while you're studying that reality\u2014judiciously, as you will\u2014we'll act again, creating other new realities, which you can study too, and that's how things will sort out.

Odd, we thought and checked to confirm that only two people are sitting there. Sure enough, just a man and woman in their mid to late 30s. This order had 5 appetizers and 5 entrees. These were people of average weight, mind you. After some investigation, we find out that 4 appetizers and four entrees were for her, and one of each for the guy. The only way we make sense of this is by assuming she was a food critic and will try each dish, send it away, and move to the next to sample a large swath of our menu. Nope. She systematically devoured every plate that came to her. All four apps in succession were completely ingested. A busser attempted to take a plate from her and she aggressively defended it, wiping up the rest of the sauce with one of the four mini loafs of bread she also consumed (which normally feeds a table of 4). Her date, on the other hand, continued cheerful conversation and ate his only appetizer. Before entrees came, she took a bathroom break then dove right back into her 2nd (or 5th?) leg of the race. Entree after entree, she calmly put down flounder, spare ribs, venison...each with their sides. In the middle of this masticating marathon, she put down a few glasses of wine and about 4 different cocktails. The man ate his only entree.

Or so I heard. \n Alright, so let me tell you about my way of vaping a bit. I usually vape on a mini Subtank V2 while at work, 0.5 ohms, fibers freaks density 2, and around 25-30W. Flavor is cool, vapor production is cool, nothing to complain about, really. Also have a Sapor dripper at home, vaping at around 0.3 ohms, 50-75W, awesome vapor production, good flavor, awesome stuff. \n But you know how things are when you're a vaper. You see a new tank/dripper/whatever and you're just like \"Oh man, I need this!\". Mostly because I wanted bigger airflows (I'm way too used to my dripper, and Subtank airflows now seem a bit too small for me), and... Because the black paint of my Subtank was dying. Yeah, stupid reason, whatever. \n So I came back home, took the RDA section, put fiber freaks in the coil, filled with Pinkman DIY, 50/50, 6mg, that I've been vaping all day long on my Subtank, went at around 50W because of the Clapton coil, and... Wow, that vapor production, I think it was even better than what I get with my dripper?! But well, I guess you know where this is going: no. flavor. At all. \n I first blamed it on the prebuilt Clapton coil, I'm not used to this type of coils at all, so I thought it could be that, maybe. Grabbed my kanthal, 6 spires, 2mm, put it on, 0.5 ohms. Yayz, just the same coil as in my Subtank. Put the fiber freaks, screwed back the different pieces of the tank, plugged it, filled it with the same Pinkman DIY, vaped... Still no taste. \n Well, maybe it is the juice then? Tried some Heisenberg DIY, which is pretty strong, still nothing. Horny Dew? Snake Oil? Nothing. Radiator Pluid? Oh, a bit of flavor, finally! ... Yes, this is sarcasm, I guess you guys know how strong this juice is. And if you don't, just trust me on this one. \n So I'll just screw my Subtank back for now, I guess. I'm not mad, I don't hate this tank. I want to love it, I really do. It looks awesome, the airflows are big, vapor production is massive, and I know I could love it as much as my dripper while at work but... How to love it if I can't have any flavor out of my juices? \n Have any of you guys encountered the same problem with this tank? And if so, did you manage to find a solution to be able to get some flavor out of it? Also noticed it sometimes leaks through the airflows, most probably because I didn't screw it correctly?

My breasts also fall to the sides quite a bit when I lay on my back and become more flattened. Based on the measurements maybe the tissue falls back into me? I have no idea. My breasts are uneven and I cannot really tell what shape they are. I think they are shallow because between my ribcage and the nipple (going from top to bottom of the breast) is dipped.

There is about an inch of space between my breasts (from noticeable breast tissue across to the other breast tissue) where the gore would go.

{"input_text": "I find flaws in your arguments, notably that\n> making small circles this requires considerably greater torque to pull off then if he were to do the same thing by running around the outside of the ring making large circles. \n In order to maintain the rotational velocity, a specific power input is required, let's call it P. One can either either have a low torque applied at high velocity, or a high torque applied at low velocity (since P = T Omega, T being torque and omega being rotational velocity); you got that bit right. However, in the gif, the force (that applies the torque) is fixed in location,  at the outside edge.  This is where the difference in the kid's location matter; the torque required is constant throughout the system, since it has a (assumed) constant rotational velocity. \n The reason the kid has to pull harder when he is at the center is because only the perpendicular component of the applied force is actually turned into torque - the rest becomes stress in the horizontal beam. \n Let me explain in more detail: If the kid were running perpendicular to the horizontal beam at the outside, he'd be running at the same velocity as the tangential velocity of the horizontal beam, found by v = Omega r, where r is the distance from the center of rotation to the outside edge. He'd be pulling the rope with force F, creating torque T (from T = F r) to maintain the rotational velocity. \n Now move the kid to the location he was at in the gif. The applied force is at an angle theta to the horizontal beam, but we still want to apply the same torque T. Let's assume for a moment (haha!) the the kid still pulls with force F. Now the perpendicular component is F times sin(Theta), and at a small acute angle like that it'll be equal to around 10-20% of F.. That's 5-10 times too small a force! \n Let's go mythbusters and figure out what the kid needs to do to still apply the same torque and maintain his friends speed and thus happiness. We want the same input force of F, but the applied force is now at angle Theta. Since the perpendicular component F is equal to the new applied force (I'll call it F_new) we can say the F = F_new sin(Theta), which gives us: F_new = F / sin(Theta) \n This also means that the  other  component get's wasted, as it just stresses the horizontal beam. The kid wastes a force of F/cos(Theta) the whole time! That's why he's working harder at the center: he needs a higher force to apply the same torque. \n If the gif showed the rope attached to the horizontal beam above the kid, then it would have explained the relationship between power, torque and perpendicular force reasonably well. \n If someone can correct me on some of this, or have anything to add or argue about, do please reply! :) [summary]: "}
{"input_text": "While I was riding the train through the city, I watched as a boy struggled to make his way to an open seat. The train was mostly empty, but he was blind and had a white cane. \n At the time, I was dealing with anxiety and my own unique brand of fear. But for the moment, I reflected on how fortunate I was to understand and appreciate a world of colors. I felt overwhelmed thinking about his burden, and I wondered how he felt. I wondered if he was anxious, like me. Or if he ever felt bitter or alone. \n At one point, he stood up. As he walked to the front of the train, he slowly turned around, gained his balance, and lifted his cane off the ground with his hands slightly outstretched. The train rumbled to a halt as he leaned forward, a grin spreading across his face. Then, he sat down. It was as simple as that. \nBut I will never forget that moment.\nHe stood up just to savor the sensation of a train stopping. \n But it didn\u2019t stop there. He started wondering around the train until he came across a woman. He carried the conversation, talking about her day and where she was headed. She told him she was going to lunch, but she wasn\u2019t sure where the restaurant was. Not only did this blind young man offer to show her where to go, but he offered to have this woman join him and his family for lunch. \n While I sat contemplating my own anxiety, someone who knew tragedy more intimately than me opened my eyes to a life worth living. He basked in the happiness of something as simple as a train slowing down. He showed warmth and compassion to those around him, offering help to those in need. Despite being blind, he was the one who offered to lead. \n He was a teacher to me, and he may not have even known I was on the train. My most sincere respect goes out to him. [summary]: "}
{"input_text": "A month ago, I met this guy at a bar during a Meetup Happy Hour. We hit it off pretty well, and we even left the bar to go check out some art galleries and then went to another bar for dinner. Throughout the week, we would text each other. He seemed VERY interested in me and initiated most of our conversations. It felt good to have met someone I had chemistry with who was showing plenty of interest. \n So a week later, we decide to go out for dinner. We met at 7:15 since he got out of work at 6. The first thing he does when we sit down is check his cell phone: \u201cI\u2019m really sorry but I need to see if I got any emails from work.\u201d Um\u2026.you took an Uber there and were waiting outside when I arrived (I was early, he was earlier)\u2026you couldn\u2019t check your email before? Shockingly, he didn\u2019t have any. \n Here\u2019s what else happened during our date: \n \n He told me about how he went from making $40k in a year (after graduating college) to almost $100k in two years and he bragged about his Audi and Escalade.  \n He asked me what my five-year plan was professionally and then said \u201cWould you ever consider working for me? However, you need to realize that I am a very strict boss who expects a lot from my employees.\u201d He graduated college only two years ago and we\u2019re not even in the same field.  \n He would say things like \u201cCan I ask you a question?\u201d and \u201cNow you ask me a question\u201d every single time he opened his mouth. This is how he talks. He would do the same thing at the bar and through texts! He would text me: \u201cQuestion! Blah blah?\u201d I would say \u201cCan we just have a normal conversation?\u201d and he would say \u201cNope, this is how it goes!\u201d \n He would say to me \u201cI\u2019m going to ask you a question\u2026How many other guys are you dating right now?\u201d He asked me this question at the bar already! I told him that I am not dating anyone and then I asked him the same thing and he goes \u201cYou\u2019re going to ask me the same question I asked you?!\u201d \n He asked me if I would consider going on vacation with him this summer. I told him I don\u2019t know him well enough to do that. He goes \u201cWho cares? I would go on vacation with someone I just met.\u201d Then he goes \u201cI\u2019m going to New York City in a few weeks\u2026You\u2019re not invited!\u201d He even did the stop thing with his hand. \n He asked me \u201cQuestion! Why did you agree to go on a 2nd date with me?\u201d I told him because I had a good time on the 1st date. He says \u201cNot good enough answer for me\u2026Try again\u201d WTF? Was I supposed to say how attractive, smart, and successful he is? How is my answer not acceptable? \n He only had 1 drink and at one point goes \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026I\u2019m wasted!\u201d WTF\u2026..You\u2019re not wasted after one drink and why would you even pretend to be during a dinner date. \n He asked me what I had for dinner the night before. I started telling him, \u201cI had a wrap with chicken, mayo\u2026\u201d He interrupts to say \u201cI don\u2019t like mayo.\u201d I go, \u201cThen don\u2019t eat it.\u201d He just keeps repeating over and over: \u201cI don\u2019t like mayo.\u201d This went on for a few minutes, and I never told him the rest of the sandwich. \n He was completely oblivious to how badly it was going. I made my discomfort very clear. He would say things like \u201cDamn, I love it when girls are sarcastic\u201d like he ~got my sense of humor. He asked me if I wanted to sit at the bar after dinner and go out for a movie. Um\u2026no. I bounced and he texted me 15 minutes later when I was waiting for the train asking why I had left early and what he said that offended me. I told him that we are not compatible and he said he definitely doesn\u2019t agree but if I change my mind, to give him a text. \n \n This was on the 2nd date. He acted like this after only knowing me a week. Who does that? I\u2019m really glad that he took the mask off that soon so I didn\u2019t waste any more time with him. \n After the date, I decided to do more research on him. I found out that he lied about a lot of things he told me. His LinkedIn does not match up with his job history, for example. He told me he double majored in Environmental Science and Computer Science, when he actually majored in Information Technology. Of course LinkedIn could also be a lie. \n He lied about where his family is from and where he lives. He lied about where he went to high school. I didn\u2019t even ask him where he went to HS. He volunteered that information. I asked him \u201cWhat type of music do you like?\u201d \u201cSince I went to private school in Bucks County, I like punk music.\u201d WTF do they have to do with each other? And you went to private school in a completely different county! This guy graduated HS eight years and he\u2019s lying to someone who\u2019s not even from the area about the county his high school is in. \n It\u2019s not just the lies that bother me. I am so annoyed that he thought he could act like that on a date and think that I would have no issues with it. He must have thought that because he is \u201crich\u201d and \u201csuccessful\u201d that I would put up with anything. He created this image of me where I am apparently so superficial that I would give a shit about where his family is from (He never asked me anything about my family), and so \u201cdesperate\u201d to be with someone \"well-off\u201d that I would allow him to treat me like that. \n All I wanted was to have a good second date with someone---am I really asking for too much here?

{"input_text": "Does anyone just like fall in love to the point where they would do anything for someone only after like an hour of meeting them? \n Just thinking about this after a house party my roommate was having after I came back from class around 10 pm, about 15 people was there, including a brother from my fraternity I didn't know would be there. I didn't want to deal with it and was going to go upstairs and go to bed, but I figured that would look bad so I told myself I would just grin and bear it for like an hour with this half pint of vodka I had. So, I decided to go back down. \n There was a girl that my brother brought over. Never seen her before. So I was just off to the side watching tv, as she, my brother, roommate and 4 other people were playing this drinking game. Then she asks me out of nowhere if I wanted to play. Shocked and I'm like sure. So game goes on, in this game, you have to pick a date (anytime you have drink, your 'date' has to) so I pick her, she's all excited and high fiving. We really click, were both in marching band, both like game of thrones, both want to do something with music in our life. \n So 2 hours later, party has to end so everyone leaves and before leaving, she asks if I need a ride, and I'm like \"I live here\" and she laughs silly, gives me a hug, like a two-arm, you can feel the warmth and friendliness hug, says bye and walks out. I knew then that she had me. \n Now next couple days, I see her on campus and I flip out. I feel like I wasn't good enough because only when we met, we were pretty buzzed. So I smile, wave, and get out as soon as possible. Like I want to maintain how good the night we met was instead my usual day self, which is weird being that I developed the strongest crush on her.

{"input_text": "Sometimes I find the everyday practice of making myself more likeable too much effort, or getting in the way of who I want to be. \n For starters, the idea that the most important thing is fitting in with the tribe makes me want to give up on relationships, full stop. Trying to fit in with our \"tribe\" prevents us from building bridges to those unlike us, and makes a virtue out of hunkering down with our own kind. \nI don't care if this is human nature, and I don't care if it's likely to make me feel happier or more comfortable. Using all my energy on fitting in is not going to do much for my personality or charisma in the long run. Plus, this makes love, community and all the good stuff that comes from being a social creature, available ONLY to those who fit in. \n The unfortunate slew of studies saying similarity is essential for rapport: I already know that a lot of people with unusual backgrounds or family arrangements refrain from running for office, or even from public life altogether, because they fear their lack of a traditional family life puts them at a disadvantage. Because apparently, you must have first-hand experience to really understand; so therefore having a marriage and children is the best way to demonstrate support for families. And actually sharing a background and outlook makes you a better fit in your community than merely trying to find common ground. \nIt's like we've all decided it's not worth trying to bridge differences anymore; that it's better for our emotional health just to do the easy thing, to stay in our tribe and equate \"relating to me\" with \"being like me\". How is that supposed to do anything for our empathy muscles except make them atrophy? \n The advice to stay positive tells me one thing: building relationships and taking direct action are opposed to one another. Because the latter requires you not spend all your remaining energy on putting on a happy face in order to attract others. \nMaking a good first impression and coming across as positive often require forgoing direct action either on yourself or on society. Holding back, sticking to small talk and happy faces; and above all, waiting. Letting precious time go by while you wait for others' permission to do more meaningful things.\nAnd often, acting in a way that bolsters privilege; because we may not admit it, but we find those with wherewithal more attractive. It's in our choices. \n Why does building relationships so often require you preserve the same status quo that needs to be fought? \"Wait until you build your support system before fighting The Man\"... that could take years or a lifetime; and by the time you are \"ready\", you could very well agree with The Man. (Which might be the whole point.) \n The idea that the \"right\" body language is a prerequisite: THIS is what people find more important than love, compassion, solidarity, etc? THIS is what you need to do to make others feel safe? \nSo I guess I'll be spending so much time and effort working on my body language that I won't be able to relax, because relaxation means feeling free from these obligations, which means slacking off from my body language practice. \nAnd forget about those other things I see as better; because you have to crawl before you can walk. \n More broadly, working on myself and my self-presentation means my time is not my own. My energy is not my own. My self-determination certainly will be non-existent, because for an indefinite period of time I will be expected to substitute someone else's judgment and intuition for my own. Since clearly my way hasn't worked, and I need to humble myself before the judgment of someone whose approach DOES work. \nI may not like Tony Robbins or Daniel Goleman; and I may not like how so much self-improvement advice seems to hold up a narrow range or personalities and styles as attractive; but these men have been successful with people and I haven't been, so I have no case. \n And this is indefinite, too... for all the talk about how it's up to me and I have the choice, it's NOT up to me but to my \"social betters\" to judge whether I've learned and grown enough. Because \"learning\" here means, of course, behaving and believing similar to the Golemans and Robbinses and Penelope Trunks. Becoming an enthusiastic champion of Calm Uber Alles and Happiness Is Sticking To Your Strengths, just like them. \n Overall, so much social skills advice has this tone of \"just follow directions, because that's the way life is\", that I have a bad visceral reaction to. I have NEVER felt anything good comes of buckling under to \"that's the way things are\". \nYeah, you may feel more comfortable, even happier; which works wonders for that all-important sense of calm and positivity you must project. But at what cost? Why should I gain emotional stability through resignation? \n And mark my words-- despite all the glittering promises of better social relations if only I follow the rules, despite the faith I'm expected to have in the results, it still feels like a massive sacrifice I should make that will give me insufficient ROI. (Soft skills get you trust and intimacy, sounds an awful lot like \"get some game and the girls WILL like you\", doesn't it? Both sound like instant favorable results at the push of a button, as well as say \"Well, you didn't try hard enough!\" if you don't get the outcome you want.) [summary]: "}

{"input_text": "Introduction \n YOU THOUGHT I WAS DONE MAKING THIS SHIT? HUH STAFF SERGEANT? HUH? WELL GUESS WHAT? YOU'RE WRONG. I'M BACK TO CRUISE CONTROL ON CAPS LOCK WHILE AT THE SAME TIME LAY DOWN THE LAW ABOUT A SANDBOX MILSIM CALLED ARMA 3. \n Just kidding.  Arma 3  is, as said above, a sandbox military simulation. You may have heard that mod  DayZ  having to run off of a  Arma 2 . So, you may be asking yourself, \"Are there mods like DayZ in Arma 3? Does it have a good single player story? Is the gameplay awkward like Arma 2? Can I just ignore the hardcore military simulation and just have fun with my friends?\" \n Questions and such \n Now, you probably have tons of questions about this particular title. And, I'm here to answer them. \n \"So, what exactly is Arma 3 and why do people like it so much?\" \n Arma 3 is a sandbox military simulation that allows you to do whatever you want. You want to create a simulation of a town with hostages and you have to save them? Do it. You want to blow up a town with your jet while listening to  Danger Zone ? Yep, and there's an addon for music too. You want to have a deathmatch with your friends underwater in swimming suits with underwater SMG's? Go right ahead. \n The possibilities are endless. You can play as realistically as you want, or you can play real silly like and screw around with the various vehicles and weapons. \n Before I ramble on about game modes, servers, groups, and mods, let's talk about a section of the game that some people play. \n Single player/Story \n The game is set in 2030 as a civil war is going on in the islands of Altis and Stratis. The various forces that are available in the game are NATO(North Atlantis Treaty Organization), AAF(Altian Armed Forces), and the CSAT(Canton-Protocol Strategic Alliance Treaty). \n But yes, there is a single player story with writing and voice acting. And it's actually pretty decent! \n That was my limited understanding of the story. You can read more [here]( \n I want to play Arma 3 realistically, what do I do? \n Well, it depends. Do you want to play by yourself or do you want to join a group? \n If you want to play by yourself, you pretty much have to set up your own missions and such. I can't speak on that, but you can pretty much imagine how that goes. \n If you want to join a multiplayer group, there are subquestions such as  what kind of groups do you want to join? Hardcore military or laid back but still keep the professionalism? \n If you want hardcore military, [/r/findaunit]( will help you with that. If you want to go into a group that is laid back, those exist too. I'll leave my two at the bottom in their own section. \n You can also install mods that can enhance the gameplay or make it look more pretty for screenshots. Moving along... \n Mods \n So, lets face it, Arma 3 is a game that has tons of mods. Without a modding community for a game like this, it would be dead. I mean, the company just recently had a competition to see who could have the best mod. So, here are my favorites. \n [Arma 3 Sync. Helps keep track of mods]( \n [Armaholic, the site where you can find plenty mods by yourself]( \n [All in Arma (Includes all weapons, vehicles, and maps from the previous Arma installments)]( \n [Task Force Radio. This allows you to connect through Teamspeak and talk normally in game, except everyone's voice is connected to their in game character. The immersion factor goes through the roof for me.]( \n [Dinosaurs!]( \n Those are some of my favorite mods for Arma 3. There are many more though, start exploring! \n Do I need the DLC? \n I bought the Arma 3 DLC Bundle because I wanted to support the Devs. They push out updates all the time. \n Let's talk about the paid DLC's. \n Karts - Go-Karts with actual tracks and full go-kart gear. From uniforms to helmets, to even a starting gun. \n Helicopters - Includes two helicopters, one has a changeable undercarriage that can be used for a troop transportation, medical, and sling-loading. When the DLC came out, it included the free update for firing from vehicles(The mayhem is unreal with this one) and sling loading(Using Arma 3's physics engine to rope up vehicles and items under a helo and transporting it elsewhere). Personally, I don't think you don't need this if you are short on cash. Two helis and a couple challenges? Eh. \n There will be more DLC's coming out, including the  Snipers  DLC. Which I believe will have wind effect your shots, and more sniper rifles. \n You mentioned groups above \n I did. I know of two semi-hardcore groups. I'm in one actually. \n The first, is one that many people join Arma for. [Shack Tactical]( \n And the second, the one that I'm in, [USEC (Unity Security Force)]( \n Can I have some videos of what you do in these groups? \n Yeah, sure. Here are some videos from myself and other USEC members. \n [My USEC Trailer]( \n [BANZAI! -The Game Survivor]( \n [USEC HALO Jump]( \n Should I buy this game? \n I personally think Arma 3 is a fantastic game.

{"input_text": "Some background: My girlfriend recently landed a great job that she has wanted for a long time. For the first time in her career, she is responsible for making real decisions about the company's direction and strategy, instead of just executing other people's orders. While she is really happy about this, she is also someone who places a LOT of pressure on herself to succeed and to avoid criticism, which usually leads to intense stress and anxiety if she gets any critical feedback from her boss or coworkers. She works on average between 40-50 hours a week, and her work also has a culture of coming in late and leaving late, which means she typically will only have about 4-5 hours between getting home and having to go to bed. \n I'm an artist and my career has been really taking off in the last year or so. I've had favorable reviews from a couple of really big publications, and my work has been selling well and for increasingly high prices. A very very well known artist has also been regularly championing my work in interviews and on social media, which has lead to a lot of the interest I'm currently seeing in my work. I'm only mentioning all of this to indicate that I'm a dedicated professional who takes my craft very seriously, and that I'm not just sitting around living an artist's lifestyle with no tangible results. I also supplement my income with a part time job where I work about 20-30 hours a week depending on how much work there is. \n Anyway, for the past year or two, but especially since my girlfriend has been working at her new job, she's had a habit of immediately getting on her phone or tablet as soon as we go to bed, usually browsing reddit or playing mobile games until she's tired enough to go to sleep. When she's doing this, she is usually pretty unresponsive if I try to have a conversation with her, touch her, or interact with her in any way. She also will usually become aggravated if I ask her if she wants to put her device away and spend some time together. When we talked about it two days ago, she told me that \n \n she hardly gets any free time to herself, especially given her limited time at home and the fact that she spends a decent percentage of that time doing chores \n she comes home with a lot of stress from her job, and browsing or playing games is one of the most effective ways for her to decompress \n my part time job has enough downtime that i can usually get most of my browsing out of the way before i get home \n i couldn't understand the level of stress she experiences, because art is my passion so therefore it must be mostly fun and relaxing, whereas her work is just work \n \n I completely agree with and understand the first three points, but I disagree and am even a bit upset with the last, although I haven't fully articulated this to her yet. While I am thrilled with the success I've had recently, it's also come with a lot of anxiety and pressure to live up to people's expectations. I still have moments of joy and fun with my work, but I think that's mostly what she sees, because I usually choose to try and deal with career stress on my own, since she already has so much on her plate. I think to her, I am someone who gets to relax at home and do fun art stuff while she is off at her job in the real world, and that I am being selfish and not understanding of her need for free time when I have so much of it. \n I have decided that on my end, I can try and pick up a greater percentage of household chores, and also take her out more so that she's not just sitting at home ruminating about what's gone wrong or what could go wrong at work. I also asked her to ask her employer if she could sometimes come in earlier and leave earlier, which they said was ok. I am optimistic because other than at bedtime, I do feel very connected and close to her. We still laugh a lot together and get along very well, and I really feel like this is someone I could spend the rest of my life with. Also for the first week or two in our new apartment, we didn't have internet access, and we were having a lot of great conversations (and more frequent sex) at night, so I know it's not an absolute necessity for her to be browsing then, and that our relationship has the potential to be at that level on a long-term basis if she can manage to change her behavior. \n I guess I'm just wondering if I could get some perspective from people who have been in similar situations, or some advice about how I could talk to her about this more productively.

{"input_text": "Looks like I will be the only person to provide you with a real answer. \n The problem isn't size, it is diversity.  People are far more likely to vote for things that benefit people who they feel are similar to themselves (even if that perception is completely off).

{"input_text": "Ok, I'll see if I can do the Tet Offensive justice. Basically, the Tet Offensive was a series of attacks launched by the Communist forces during a ceasefire because of the Tet Lunar New Year celebrations, hence the name of the attacks. At first, the initial attacks suprised the U.S. and South Vietnamese forces, but they quickly recovered and beat back the attacking forces, inflicting on them mass casualties. The main focal point of the attack was Saigon, but there was also major fighting at Hue and Khe Sanh. \n So, the points of view: \n Communist Forces (North Vietnam): \n The population of South Vietnam were unhappy with the U.S. occupation, and if widespread attacks were launched then they would spark a South Vietnamese uprising which would lead to an easy victory. \n The U.S. and South Vietnam (but mainly the U.S.): \n They sensed the shift in communist planning, and suspected that something was in the works. General Westmoreland cabled Washington to say he expected communists to undertake \"an intensified countrywide effort\". However, when the attacks were launched, even Westmoreland was shocked by the scale. They had never seen qthe Communist forces plan something quite this big, and on such a large scale. \n Conclusion: The Communist forces were defeated, and some argue that the effectiveness of the Vietcong was crippled from that day forward, as they suffered so many casualties. However, Nguyen Thieu took this opportunity to give himself sweeping powers, and the citizens of South Vietnam had lost faith in the government's ability to protect their citizens. [summary]: "}

After I blew my load she straightened up and said that I could never tell anyone. I wasn't about to, plus no one would ever believe me anyways. Over the following months we had a few more interactions after class, usually at least once a week, but this was before everyone had a cell phone or at the very least an e-mail so it just stopped after that school year was over.

{"input_text": "A few years back, I met this HB9 in high school. We casually talked in class, and apparently I charmed her into offering her number to me. We exchanged numbers then, but we never really texted. The reason we never texted at the time was because I was in a relationship and I didn't really feel the need to, I guess, considering I was already with a girl that made me happy. Well, the happiness ended and we broke up about 10 months back, so I was on the prowl again. I texted HB9 and suggested that we should go on a date, she accepted and it was on. (The catch now was that SHE was in a relationship, but their relationship included open dating, so it was cool for me to take her out, but no move-making.) Only about 2 months after our date, she and her boyfriend broke up. This is where shit gets banana flapjack crazy. (What happens next is all before I found the holy grail, that is, Seddit.) The breakup was good news for me, because I was going to see if I could take it further. We pinged each other with funny texts and texted conversations a lot, mostly of me asking her things. She showed that she liked me and offered for me to come over to a family reunion party. I accepted and we went to the party, everything went great and by the end of the night we were snuggled up by the fire, I was holding her and caressing her arms. I went home and from then on I just got super fucking beta. I was all \"nice guy\" with her and saying I'd go out of my way to do things for her. Needless to say, she lost interest quick, it was very obvious. She gave me one more chance and she came over and we cuddled in bed and I kissed her on the ear a couple times, but never escalated. She went to work after that, I GOT EVEN MORE BETA. Things got bitter and we just stopped talking altogether. (That was all about 5 months ago, and then about 3 months ago I found Seddit, and I absorbed like a motherfucker.) Yesterday we ran into each other and I turned on my charm, she fell for it, and instead of being all beta, I'm all alpha now, which I think made her fall even more. Now this morning she pings me and says, \"Today is Harry Houdini's 137th birthday!!\", I responded by saying, \"He'd have been a real magician if he would have lived this long. Coolest magic trick ever.\", she then completed our conversation by saying \"For real!\". Her texting me out of the blue when we haven't talked in 5 months seems like an IOI to me, she was obviously thinking about me since she texted me. \n The questions raised from all of this: What should I do to make the next move, knowing the game better.

And the current Earnings Per Share is -$0.30. That's right. Twitter is a losing company at the moment. By just holding the stock, you are losing money, regardless of what your shares are worth on the market. With BitCoin, you are not.

The dark there was an unusual form that gave peace, comfort and rest to Undead and while powerful was handled by a 'religious order' composed of Fenitos and the Wardens. The Wardens are mentioned in DKS3 to do with Grave Lord Wolnir and the black flame pyromancy highlighting their connection with dark and tainted dark. \n The fact that they 'discovered' it later means to me that overtime their organisation lost their way and started to corrupt the peaceful Dark and unlike Manus did in a slower way achieving different but still horrible results as they messed around with it. \n I don't have any item descriptions on hand so I don't really know if anything disputes this or if its already been proven wrong but it seems to fit I think. \n The fact that Vendrick's shield is in Smouldering Lake could imply that it fell from the Catacombs - to me the timeline goes like this: Drangleic falls, soon enough a new kingdom is built and the Undead Crypt is discovered, soon enough they start messing around with it, at some point the worm is driven out and along with it the shield. I don't know if this means the Catacombs is a future version of the Undead Crypt repurposed possibly? \n At any rate Wolnir was too forceful with the investigations and only called on the Abyss, meanwhile his lackeys the former Grave Wardens established a religions or possibly perverted the old ways and made the Church of the Deep as they slowly converted the Peaceful Dark into a more subtle, different but still corrupted Dark.

(Foreign tube sites are also supported and text auto-translated, with your search terms auto-translated back into native site language before search is performed.)   You can also shout at anytime what you want to see and Siri will get it for you. (Siri, did this girl ever get gangbanged?  How about other girls from Slovakia?).\nHowever, here at Apple we don't ever do things half ass.  Apple has partnered with Pornhub, Redtube, Youjizz, and Beeg to bring you a truly Apple spin on the old fap experience.  Today we also introduce AppleFap w/AppleJizz. \n With AppleFap w/AppleJizz,  AppleTV and Apple Watch learn how you watch porn and how it affects your heart rate and hand motion to map the different stages of your fap.  It usually takes around a week or more for the initial learning cycle to complete, but never stops learning.  When a tube site encodes their files with the AppleJizz h.264 extension tags, clips are enhanced with standardized metadata throughout the clip with timecode tags denoting positions, number and gender of people, key moments (ejaculation etc.).   AppleTV will figure out which positions and scenarios for a selected fap session goal, (Quick Fap, Fap, or Edge) based on biofeedback from Apple Watch tailored to you on the fly.  If you're into something, mid-fap it detects and knows it and shows you more or more clips of the same, if not, it switches to something else.  You can filter out things you never want to see and they will be seamlessly edited out(Siri, I don't ever want to see a closeup of a mans face).  And because Apple TV can queue up, switch, seek and loop simultaneously 8 streams in the background and instantly switch between which one it shown on screen(or split screen up to 4 shown at once), control over the experience can be very finite achieving a true custom fap with not a pause or buffer sure to please even the most ADHD overstimulated fapper. \n Just tell Siri the fap session goal you would like to go for, and AppleFap w/AppleJizz will take care of the rest.

I know some of you out there love giving advice aswell.\n Important Stuff \n I'm eventually no matter what anyone says, going to upload gameplay footage of me playing games in which I do well, okay, or terrible in so - \n \n I can watch them back and see my mistakes 2. You can watch them and leave comments or whatever and tell me what I've done wrong, how I can improve etc. 3. Some of you might just wanna watch a Silver 4 try hard and get a laugh out of a game which is fine. 4. Maybe people out there will learn from this aswell\nSorry I ranted for so long at the start there but I know some people will read it....probably. [summary]: "}
{"input_text": "I would like to continue on building on the work started here by /u/PulvisEtUmbraSumus.  In his [post 2 months ago,]( he started a mass rite to help the Yazidis, and provided various sigils for Melek Taus. \n Helping the Yazidis \n What I am proposing is to send angelic forms to the Yazidi women who have become sex slaves of the Islamic State. The purpose of this is to energetically provide some sort of comfort, condolence, or solace to these women and children who are experiencing the worst kind of horrors.  We need to send these women a vibration of love and compassion, and use our energy to fuel the benevolent beings already out there working with these people. \n I am emphasizing the Yazidi sex slaves and children because it seems like they are the ones that are exposed to the most painful evil. As a woman and mother, this is the pain and oppression that I am personally being called to target through my work.  However, I think it's important to keep ALL of the Yazidis in mind, including men, refugees, women not in slavery, etc. They all need our help! \n Here are some ideas: \n \u2022 Evoke angels and other benevolent beings of light. During the evocation, ask them specifically to comfort these women in their dark hour, and focus your energy on aiding them. Burn candles, give offerings, recite your favorite mantras, etc as a way to energize your request. \n \u2022 Invoke angels and other beings of light. Invoke their light directly into yourself, and drum up all of your love and compassion.  Then visualize yourself as the angel traveling directly to the Yazidis and pour your love and compassion on them. \n \u2022 Invoke the Christic energy and send it in the direction of the Yazidis. If you want, you can visualize yourself traveling there and delivering the Christic energy directly. Focus on compassion and deliverance. \n \u2022 Create a visualization. Start off with feeling all of the love and compassion in your heart, and visualize a ball of white light in your heart.  Make the ball grow and grow.  At the same time, visualize the Yazidis you want to help and create an energetic bridge between your physical location and their physical location.  Send them your white light through your bridge.  Once you're done with your visualization, tell the bridge and the ball of white light to \"stay\", so that it continues working even if you're doing something else.  Go back and charge the bridge and the light intermittently throughout the day or week. \n \u2022 Create an angelic visualization.  Basically, the same thing as above, except instead of \"ball of light\", create an angel being. Then create a bridge, and send the Yazidis your angel. \n \u2022 Use the sigils provided by /u/PulvisEtUmbraSumus.  Alternatively, you can create your own sigils with your favorite entities/patrons for the purpose of comforting and aiding the Yazidis. \n We can help these people (if only from far away) if we really put our mind, intention, and care into it!  I know it seems  like a fool's errand, but if you feel any compassion at all towards these people, it's important to focus that compassion and send it their way. \n The Islamic State \n Helping the Yazidis is not complete without targeting the source of their turmoil. The Islamic State must be dealt with energetically as well. The horrors that are ensuing right now are the result of a victim/perpetrator polarity.  This is probably going to sound ludicrous to most, but to TRULY address this polarity and effect real change, the negative energy must be neutralized. \n Throughout this whole exercise, the hardest thing for me has been sending my good energy and love to the Islamic State in an effort to neutralize that negative energy.  For me, IS is the most disgusting and reprehensible thing ever and I can't think about them for 20 seconds before I start fantasizing about killing them and violently eradicating their pestilence from this world. I find myself in fantasies of liberating the women and torturing the rapists mideval-style.  It has come to my attention that I need to put on my big-girl magus panties, get over my own ego, and fight these motherfuckers head on (energetically, of course).  So I am sending them my love and compassion. Please note that I do not love nor feel compassion for IS directly, for me this is a chemical act, where I am basically pouring base to neutralize their acid.  I realize that this is not for everyone! This is something I'm specifically being called to. So if you would rather unleash the fury of djinn on these dicksuckers, go right ahead. [summary]: "}

{"input_text": "I was dating this really sweet, but shy, girl.  I was the first the boy she had ever been with and this story will only make this point obvious. \n The first thing she did was spend a good 15 minutes staring at the thing, looking up at me, and breathing really purposefully.  She was obviously very nervous, which I thought was adorable. \n I told her, \"We don't have this right now if you don't want.\"\n\"No.\" Deep breath. \"I can do this.\" \n She's just sitting at the foot of the bed, psyching herself up.  I'm trying not to laugh because this is funny to me.  Not in a mean way; I was in love with this girl.  It was very typical of her.  And I wanted to be supportive (and get a blowjob). \n While all of this is happening, I start to lose my erection.  I mean, we were both kinda just lying there, and not in a tantric way.  She notices this (obviously) and looks really disappointed with herself.  I tell her, \"It's alright,\" and pull her closer and we start kissing. \n So, Johnny's come marching home again.  I place her hand on my penis and she starts stroking it.  After a while, she looks at me and says, \"Ok.\"  She goes down, hesitates for a few seconds (maybe longer), and finally puts it in her mouth. \n So, I'm feeling really great about myself.  My dick feels really great about itself.  About a minute in, disaster strikes. \n She gets up and says, I quote, \"Ok.  I'm done.\" \n I give her this look like, \"For realz?\" but I realize this is a big step forward for her and I don't want to be mean about it.  I was also personally too embarrassed to explain to her exactly what an ejaculation was and how a penis works.  In retrospect, should have just talked about it and everything would probably have been fine.  But, like the inexperienced teenager I was, I didn't.  I sat in bed with my blue balls until she left. \n This would also create a bit of a situation the next time, when I actually did come. [summary]: "}
{"input_text": "Depending on what you're washing with, more than 2x a day will probably just aggravate your skin more and make it greasier. Keeping everything really clean helped me a lot. I change pillowcases every three days, bought a pile of washclothes I can bleach regularly, and I don't touch my face unless I've washed my hands first. \n My skin has calmed down a lot since I found /r/SkincareAddiction and stopped using harsh cleansers on it. My routine at night, I take off makeup with mineral oil and I wash with a really [gentle cleanser]( then I use a chemical exfoliant like Paula's Choice BHA gel, let that set for 20 minutes and then moisturize with Cerave cream. In the morning I wash with the cleanser and put on sunscreen. \n What else? Honey masks feel really good on aggravated skin, so does olive oil but some people don't react well to that oil.  Just slap on honey and let it dry. I do that with aloe gel too and it helps it stick better. Grapeseed oil and sweet almond oil also feel really great. I know it seems counter-intuitive because you're probably already oily but my skin has always been oily and really dehydrated because I was never moisturizing enough (because of the oil) but moisturizing helps me a ton with calming down oil production and the less oily I am the less I break out. And it just feels so luxurious to rub almond oil or honey on your face. I feel like Nefertiti. \n Green concealers work best for me when I'm covering a pimple. I have [physician's formula]( and I'm pretty happy with it, it's thick and creamy and stays put. I use the green and blend in with a concealer brush and then cover that with Revlon colorstay foundation and set with a bit of powder. I haven't found a skin colored concealer I like yet. And flaky spots, if my face can handle exfoliating I do that first and than moisturize. \n This got really long! I've had bad acne for about 15 years now. This past year it's really gotten better and I don't know if that's my skin actually changing or because I've simplified my routine so much. [summary]: "}
{"input_text": "I came back to finish answering your other questions. Mostly because when I first replied, I was watching the mayweather fight. \n I don't think Empty the Pits or Army of the Damned aren't good cards to add, but I also am a fan of a slightly lower curve for mono black (at least how I play). For that much mana, you should be aiming to just win the game, and empty definitely doesn't fit that description. And if you are winning off of empty, then it won't really be fueling contamination. Army of the Damned is another one where if it isn't winning the game for you, it isn't doing enough and probably should be cut. \n Bloodghast is good, and it works really well with skullclamp (another fantastic card). I also am running Gisa, so having a repeatable creature to sac to Gisa is super useful, especially after a board wipe. \n Yawg's Will is an absolute house. It will end games. you can do stupid things like cast yawg's will, board wipe, ramp some, play a land, then play like 4 creatures. it's amazing. Absolutely worth the price. \n I don't think you understand how slow a black deck is. You always have time to play a myriad landscape, and mono black needs/wants  all  the ramp it can get. In my mono black deck, I'm running Charcoal Diamond, Jet Medallion, Mana Crypt, Sol Ring, Worn Powerstone, Mox Diamond, and Wayfarer's bauble all as artifact ways to get ahead on mana. On top of that I'm also running things like Crucible to hit every land drop, and expedition map to find cabal coffers. Black is literally the most mana hungry color, and in EDH it is even more so. Myriad Landscape provides you with something that is extremely hard to get; a spell in land form. Like Bojuka Bog, you are basically playing a free spell as a land (in this case, Wayfarer's Bauble). Run the Landscape, trust me. \n When it comes to mono black commanders, the important thing is that the commander really does influence the deck, and mono black has a ton of sweet commanders you can play. The thing is, you need to focus your deck down a little more. Right now, it is split between big mana, sacrificing as a theme, and then reanimation. Maga works well with the big mana theme, and having a fireball as a commander isn't a bad thing. However, the other 2 don't work well at all. And to be honest, I would consider cutting one of the themes. Personally, the reanimation subtheme is by far the weakest, especially since your commander doesn't interact with that at all. A better reanimator general is Chainer, Dementia Master (a personal favorite card, and one that can be jammed into any deck). In terms of sacrifice as a theme, I'm a big fan of Gisa; Gisa lets you play a sac deck, but also lets you play a stax deck. Effects like Smokestacks are a lot better when you are make 3 zombies a turn for free. Contamination becomes a lot better when you can almost always fuel it. Maga lends herself to a decent big mana theme, but another good commander is Drana, Kalastria Bloodchief. You basically use Drana as a way to keep the board clear while attacking for large amounts of damage. \n My [summary]: "}
{"input_text": "My boyfriend and I were together for 6 months before we broke month 1.5 months ago, the day before we were supposed to go on a holiday with his family. Reason being he felt I was too temperamental and did not respect him enough in general. He felt we were finally ready, that he wanted to welcome me to his family and actually spend more time with his family, for them to know me and for me to know them better. Which I admit to being temperamental of which I have always been, so immediately after the break up I felt I had hurt too many people who cares about me because of my temper, so I began to change and am still working really hard on it and I have improved. As for not respecting him, I have always had a lot of respect for him, but I failed at showing it and I know that was 100% my fault. Ruining the holiday, he said made a reunion incredibly unlikely. The fact that I started a fight with him on such an important day and would not just swallow my pride and apologise. While the details of this story is actually a bit more complicated and had quite some misunderstanding on all parts, I do agree that it was ultimately my fault and I should've handled it a lot better than I did. \n After the breakup I went crazy at texting him, which pushed him further away and he would ignore me, when I actually wanted him back. But since the texting calmed down a bit the past couple of days, strange enough...we started talking again, very positively. He even flirted with me a bit, sex was mentioned (we DID NOT ask to have sex and made it clear we wouldn't do that as it would complicate things, but we talked about sex a lot), he complimented me a lot and we would texts for hours and hours non stop. However, for 2 nights, he brought up things about the relationship and we had quite some heavy convos, we talked about the relationship in detail and both agreed that the relationship would have been so much better if we had talked like this before. Anyhow, while I haven't asked to get back with him, I tested the waters to see how he felt about it and I realise that his decision of breaking up with me was incredibly difficult on him, that I really hurt him during the relationship. He is afraid of giving me a chance because he doesn't want to get hurt again. Now I know I have been working really hard on improving my ways, and I will continue to do so, as this change would improve me as a person, not only just as a girlfriend, but in a lot of aspects as well. I want him to see that I have changed before asking him if he was willing to try again, I want to show him I've changed. However, I really don't want to hurt him again, and I worry the way I ask him is going to make it difficult for him.  \n We have talked about meeting up for the first time since the breakup, but he doesn't know when he would be free, as he's been very busy with work, but I think we will see each other soon.  \n I have stopped trying to fight for him a while ago as I felt he didn't want that, but I do want to get him back, and I want to make sure I wouldn't hurt him again, at the very least, it cannot be the same reason twice. I cannot see him hurt, but right now...from the things he told me...he's still hurting from the relationship and the breakup. I don't know how to show him my improvements, I don't even know if asking him to come back would be a good idea, I don't know if I could really trust myself with his kind, sweet, loving, and right now very fragile heart. So I need some advice...because I love him, I want him to be happy, I want him to be with me. I do however think him being happy is more important, even if it's not with me. He knows I'm not over him and I get the feeling that he does want to be with me, he just couldn't trust me with his emotions and I don't know what to do about it. [summary]: "}

{"input_text": "I want to start off by saying that I should of just built it myself. There are 2 reasons why I just didn't buy everything and do it myself. \n \n I hate doing cable management. But I wanted it done. \n I just didn't want to. \n \n So here is the thing. I was watching IEM Katowice and there was an AD for a limited edition IEM PC. Well I was really wanting a new PC so I went to the site to give it a look. It looked like a decent PC for a good price. I upgraded a few things but not the power supply. I'll get that back in a few. \n This is where my uncertainties with my decision started to kick in. I am currently Overseas stationed in South Korea. My address is an APO so no biggie because they ship to APO. So I choose the $69 dollar option for \"Ready to Ship in 3 Days\". This was on the 3rd of March.(Technically late at night on March 2nd back in 'Murica) So The next day (the 3rd of March PST) the email was sent to me that my order had been received. I'm thinking awesome!!! It'll be done Saturdayish and more than likely ship out sometime Monday. \n I didn't bother sending an E-mail because I figured if there were any issues that they were going to contact me. Well I guess I was slightly mistaken. The next email was not sent by CyberPower until March 7th. Saying that my order had been \"Authorized\". This was March 7th 3 'work days' 4 if you count Saturday after they received my order.   *Now I understand there is a slight time delay between me being in Korea and them being in Cali. Which is why I am using PST dates and time as a reference** . So I send an email back to them asking this question, Is the \"rush, ready to ship in 3 days\" go off of order received date or a different date? \n They responded on the 8th of March. Which is now way past the 3 days. But they responded with a very reasonable answer stating that some of the parts for my PC were currently unavailable in their warehouse and that they were going to have to wait until parts came into to finish the assembly of my PC.Cool, I get it. Sometimes there is an issue in your inventory and you think you have something and it turns out that you don't. I get it, it sucks, but I get it. But that is all they sent me back. Nothing about the fact that they would be refunding my 69 dollars. So I sent another email asking just that. If I needed to do anything to get my money back or will it be automatically refunded. I did not receive an answer back. \n On March 10th I finally got an Email saying my PC was in production. Awesome thank you for the update. I replied to that Email, again asking if my 69 dollars would be refunded(at the time it had not shown up as refunded in my back account yet.) They finally answered me and told yes that it would be refunded and that I didn't not need to provide them with anything. \n On the 15th of March I got an \"Invoice\" email. Which I thought was awkward. Mainly because it did not contain any Shipping Information or Tracking Number. So 2 or 3 times a day for the next day or two I checked the \"Order Status\" page on their website. It had not been updated in almost a week. So I finally decided to send an email asking had my PC been shipped yet? They responded that it had indeed been shipped out on the 15th and provided me with a Tracking Number. Awesome, Finally 13 days after ordering my PC had finally been shipped out to me. \n My PC finally gets here. The first positive I will say is that it was packed well. I finally got the Tower out of the box and opened up the case and removed the packing. Reconnected one of the Video Cards PCI-E connectors.(I assume it fell out during shipping nothing can be done about that). I checked out the entire Water Cooling system it look good and the reservoir was fairly full. Sweet I connected the bad boy up and powered it up. All the fans started spinning the reservoir started pumping the water everything seemed all good. I did the Windows initial setup. But during this I noticed the PC started to get progressively getting slower, Until it finally shut itself off. Ok, I've built my own PC's in the past and have had an issue like this before so I re seated the Vid Card, RAM, and HDD's. Booted it back up and it shut down again, almost immediately. So I disconnected the Vid Card plugged the monitor into the on board graphics port to see if the Vid Card was faulty and could be causing the issue. No joy. Well this time I was sitting down on the floor watching what was going on inside it to see if I could spot anything. \n Low and behold I finally spot it. There was no water flowing through the hoses. I touched the heat sink and sure enough it was hot to the touch. I checked the reservoir and it was basically empty. Thought to myself ok no problem this is why I bought an extra thing of coolant. Well I go to check the boxes and there is no bottle of coolant.(So I'm pretty sure I was jipped out of a 10 dollar bottle of coolant.) So I had some distilled water laying around so I added water to the reservoir and booted it up again and finally there was water flowing through the hoses. Awesome everything is all good. I started installing all my games. And for the next 6 days everything seemed perfect. \n Now back to not upgrading the Power Supply. Since I waited like 13 days in that time I started finding more and more YouTube reviews about the default PSU that CP used in their PC's. And everyone, and I MEAN EVERYONE said their PSU's absolutely suck. Well So far I had 0 issues with it. On Sunday, 6 days after first use of the PC it finally happened. I heard a loud click and my PC shut down. I tried to reboot and nothing. Luckily I had an old 500 Watt PSU laying around. So I plugged it into the MOBO and CPU spot and turned on the PC to see if it would boot. It did. So awesome, I now know it's only my PSU that is fried. Not the rest of my PC. So I immediately contact CP support explaining my situation and what happened. They very quickly responded saying that obviously I am covered and that I can send back the old PSU and they will send me out a replacement PSU. I sent an email back asking them what do I have to do to get this process started. That was on the 27th. I have yet to hear anything back to them. So on base they have a little PC repair shop that sells some parts. So I was able to go over yesterday and buy a new Crosair PSU. Installed it and as of right now, everything is working. Obviously I don't want to throw in a replacement crappy PSU that only last 6 days. So I'll take the lost on that. \n Overall am I happy with the PC? Well I mean yes, It basically running games as good as I expected. But I mean after replacing the PSU it's almost completely defeated the purpose of buying a Pre-Built gaming PC. [summary]: "}

Now of course I got my monies worth in around 800 hours of gameplay and I'm glad for that, but now I'm a litle annoyed. \n For new guardians, $60 gets them everything where as for those of us who have bought everything it will be $135. Now obviously this happens as games get older, they drop in price, and I don't think we should get The Taken King for free, but for an extra $20 new guardians can get exclusive emotes, shaders, and exotic class items. \n For those of us who own everything, we'd essentially be paying $40 for 3 emotes, 3 shaders, and 3 class items if we wanted those as we already own Destiny, Dark Below, and House of Wolves. \n So in my opinion, and I hope a lot of you agree with me, the digital edition of The Taken King should include the collectors edition content in the VIP pack for those of us who bought both expansions previously. \n I'm sure that many of my fellow guardians will be getting the physical Collector's Edition, not going to lie, I'm tempted. But for those of us who don't want that, paying $80 for a piece of $40 content and then $40 just to get the exclusive items is a bit annoying. All of the digital content should come to those of us who have already bought the game and both expansions, it just seems fair to me. \n Now, I know some people might say oh it's just stupid digital content that doesn't matter, if someone wants to spend $40 on it let them. That's an understandable way to look at it, but I also feel that those of us who have been loyal and bought everything at full or near to full price shouldn't be punished as we essentially are as if we want that content we have to pay $80. We shouldn't have to, in my opinion. This isn't entitlement, it's just not wanting to pay an extra $40 for some digital content for those of us who have already bought all of the existing content. \n All this being said, I do feel bad about complaining when we got such a great trailer and such great supers, but this is something I feel should be brought up as soon as possible so hopefully Bungie can consider it.

{"input_text": "Grab some popcorn. \n I was alone, and it was very dark and cold. I held in my hands a Mosin 9130 that'd been through hell, notches in the stock from its former owner and a touch of oxidation on the exposed metal. My fingers ached on the wood grain, nipped and bitten by the brisk wind that seemed to cut right through my body. \n I panted vigorously, my breath swirled away in the hollow breeze. A twig was poking me in my back, and I was very uncomfortable. That'd been the least of my concern. \n I'd been running, my body shook violently from the cold and exhaustion. I couldn't remember the last time I'd eaten anything worth acknowledgement. \n But not even malnutrition nor the Eastern European cold could break my conditioned hard focus, as I'd had my eyes set on the building a few hundred meters ahead of me. \n Gunshots rang out a few moments prior, and the muzzle flash lit up the airfield in the same way a strobe light might have. \n It was quiet now, the exchange of lead had ceased, and I was waiting. Waiting for just the right time to make my move. \n I lifted the rifle to my shoulder and pointed its business end towards the Air Traffic Control Tower in the distance, where'd I'd seen the muzzleflash of what I presumed to be some sort of single action rifle. \n The wind was horrible, and the cold worse. My hands trembled as I scanned the horizon. It was difficult to identify anything. \n Pop!  Another shot in the distance, right where I'd expected it to be from. The Control Tower. \n I lowered myself closer to the ground and rested my rifle on a branch that jutted out of a dead bush to my right. A few twigs snapped, though it was hardly audible in the howling wind - even to myself.\nI felt a touch more safe, though that was a joke. \n Is there anyone near me? I looked around carefully, eyeing the bushes and tall grass surrounding me.\nI grunted quietly, and looked into my scope. \n Focused on the Air Traffic Control Tower, I scanned the building to the best of my abilities. No movement, no gunfire. \n I waited, hoping that whoever exchanged fire both successfully landed shots. \n Time passed, and I just remember freezing my ass off. \n After a while of waiting, I was about to cut my losses and return to camp to warm up and take a lousy shot at getting a restful night's sleep. I did my final scans of the building, eyeing every corner and window. \n There was movement, just at the top of the tower. It was painfully subtle, so I couldn't be positive that it was anything significant. Until it moved again. \n I shallowed my breathing, concentrating on holding steady. My finger tips were numb and painful, and my body shook violently in the cold. I held out, and kept watching. \n The figure shuffled forward, not with the wind - but on its own.\n Gotcha. \n My finger met the trigger ever so gently, just barely making contact. \n Looks to be about 400 meters  I guessed, though it was increasingly harder to tell as the night had began to overtake the dusk. \n I made the proper adjustments on my scope, my fingers ached with the turning of notches in the cold.\nThe wind had died slightly, and I prepared for the shot. I reinforced the grip that I'd had on my rifle and dug my boot and knee into the ground wholesomely. \n My crosshairs bounced all about the building, dancing in a mocking fashion. \n POP  The shot cracked into the night, the ambience had seemed to have completely died as every other sound was rendered inaudible in that very moment. \n I opened the bolt and a hot casing flung into the dirt, I peeked into the empty chamber and hurriedly loaded a few more shots. \n Scoping back in, I saw the figure rise to a kneeling position and begin to bandage frantically. I took another shot.\n POP  Another nerve-racking crack of a bullet flying into the darkness. \n The figure hit the ground. I chambered another and shot once more. \n POP  The bullet flew. I could only guess where it landed. \n I recollected after the shot, lined up, and shot again. \n POP  The round passed straight through his chest just under his right shoulderblade. The figure went limp and smacked the ground, never to stand again. [summary]: "}

{"input_text": "My issue with skyrim is the logic of the video game outright. \n A RPG with a linear scale of leveling is based on zones. You enter a zone and you're either underpowered or overpowered for that zone statically. Since the freedom to explore is more important in skyrim than the linear direction of going through zones, you have to remove this to allow for people to write their own story. Some go south, some go north... and the challenges evolve around your personal experience. It's as if locations just have an algorithm of: \n (your experience + 3) for a difficult experience (aka bossfight)\n(your experience) general mobs\n(your experience - 3) for simple experiences (animals) \n instead of zone 40 / zone 50 / zone 60 ect... \n Once I figured out that the game was evolving the world around me... it honestly took me out of it. It lost that \"holy shit... where the fuck em I going... and what the fuck is going to happen\" or \"look at this fucking monster he is going to fucking kill me I should run\". Or even better \"What the fuck did I just find... there's something in here that's going to fucking one hit me\"... that I absolutely loved from the first 40 hours of this game. It gave the content it's value. \n I watched my roomate get massacred in dark souls and it seemed like everywhere he went... it was just terrifying. The issue I have against that is, it's more about being fucked with, instead of exploring. I just wish skyrim had more of this vibe. \n I'm sure the game architects had real trouble thinking this through, and the balance made the first half of the game absolutely incredible. Honestly, but after awhile I just felt like I was clicking the screen instead of trying to find valuable resources to battle things I have no business battling. \n I played the ESO online beta, and I vibed out on how expansive and well constructed the worlds were. It certainly gave the same \"you don't belong in this zone\" vibe. But the quality and craftsmanship was more commoditized (let's say WOW'd out a bit) to really gain any value from your discoveries. \n I've thought about this a lot. And it boils down to the product that's being sold. True story telling and well constructed game play that provides a satisfying experience is difficult and shouldn't be automated.

Lady brings in her computer and says I need to fix it. \n \"This is bullshit,\" she said for the first of many times.  \"I'm a teacher, I have a ton of work to do, I have a massive hangover and the computer you sold me is not working the way it should.  I bought it in October and it is already broken.  This is bullshit, I want a refund or for you to go get me the exact same model and exchange it.\" \n I ask her if she was a gold member (one time fee covers all labor costs for a year) or if she purchased a store warranty on her computer. \n \"No, this is a new computer.  It isn't supposed to break for years.  This is bullshit.  You need to replace it.\" \n So I go through my patient routine about how I want to help her (and I honestly do) but I can't do it for free. \n \"This is bullshit. The computer isn't even a year old, it should be covered by warranty.\" \n So then I explain to belligerent hungover teacher lady (hereby designated BHTL) that it is within HP's warranty period, but I'm not HP.  I'll give her the warranty info so she can start the process but it will likely take a few weeks between hp shipping her a box, her shipping it out, them examining it and possibly repairing it, possibly rejecting the repair, then shipping it back to her. \n \"That is bullshit, I need my computer fixed now.  I'm a teacher and I have work to do!\" \n So I explain what it will take me to fix it.  Pay me to take it apart and diagnose what is going on and we go from there. \n \"Will that fix it?\" \n \"It depends.  If it ends up being a software issue, then that will normally cover the cost of the fix.  If it is a hardware issue then you will still need to pay for the parts but installation labor costs are waived.\" \n \"That is bullshit.\" \n So I lay it out.  If she wants to go though warranty, I will get her HP's contact info and she can go through the 3-5 week process on her own.  If she wants me to do it I need to charge to find out the problem, and there may or may not be more charges once I understand what is going on. \n She finally relents, pays me, and goes on her way. \n So... on to the problem. \n She stated when she started it up this morning that her welcome screen appeared, and the password field started populating by itself and wouldn't stop, so she did a hard shutdown.  She rebooted and couldn't then couldn't enter her password at all.  Then she came to me. \n So I fire it up and get this continuous, unending beep until I power it down.  Reboot, same thing.  Pull the battery, power drain, reboot and it loads the \"Windows didn't shut down right, repair computer or start normally?\"  I hit enter to start normal and nothing happens.  I hit the up arrow to select something else, nothing.  I let it sit to time out on start normally and nothing happens for a few minutes.  Reboot and the continuous unending beep happens again.  \"Probably keyboard related,\" I think. \n Ok, so I start taking it apart.  Step one: remove bottom panels and hdd, odd, ram and wifi.  As I pull the panel off, there is a spot of sticky stuff on it.  I look on the laptop, there is a matching spot of sticky stuff and it happens to be near a hole in the chassis that leads deeper down next to the odd.  So I pull the ODD, and there is a full on drop of the sticky stuff on the top of it.  Hmmmm.... \n So I remove everything else and flip it over and remove the keyboard.  \"That is strange, it feels like I left a screw in,\" I say to myself.  Flip it back over, \"Nope, got every screw.\"  Check service manual, \"Nope, I really did get every screw.\" \n So I go back and start lifting the keyboard again, with a little extra pressure, and it slowly becomes unglued as I lift it. \n As I lift the keyboard, I find the most extensive fluid damage I've ever seen.  That little dab of sticky stuff on the ODD?  It was covering everything under the keyboard. \n Everything. \n All over the motherboard, in and around every zif connector, and dripping down into the chassis below.  I lift it to my nose and take a wiff. \n [Pina Colada!]( \n Whelp, there is the problem! \n So I look up some parts, and find replacing all the parts coated in goo would be more expensive than replacing the laptop all together. \n So I call her up and find her drunk.  I have to explain multiple times that, yes her computer is fixable, but it would be cheaper to get a new computer. \n \"That is bullshit, what about the $75 I just paid you?\" \n I tell her I'll put that toward getting her new computer set up and the data transferred. \n \"That is bullshit, I want the money off a new computer.\" \n \"No,\" I tell her, \"It doesn't work like that.  Parts, computers are sold at the advertised price, but I would be willing to put it toward labor on a new computer setup.\" \n \"So my $75 is just thrown away then!?  That is bullshit!\" \n \"No, your $75 went toward me finding the scope of the problem, namely that you spilled pina colada all over your laptop, wiped it down, and brought it back to me demanding a replacement for free.  That is the real bullshit.  Now if you want me to help you, then stop bullshitting me and we can work together.  I'm in this business to help people, not scam people, but I'm also in  business  so I can't give you services for free.\" \n BHTL.... \"That is bullshit, just sell me your cheapest laptop and give me my computer back.\"  So I sell her my cheapest laptop and let the door hit her in the ass on the way out.

{"input_text": "I came back in during M13, and I picked up two intro packs. Talrand, and Krenko. For those of you who don't remember, these two dudes were baller. One of them made 2/2 flyers any time you cast an instant or sorcery. The other made a zillion goblin tokens just by looking at you funny. \n After playing with these two sweet decks for a while, and buffing them up and making them more consistent with some cards I'd opened in boosters, I made a funny realization. \"Wait a second. Krenko's Command. It gives you two goblin tokens. For Krenko to duplicate. But it's a sorcery. So it gives you a Drake from Talrand!\" You can imagine my eyes, when I realized that if I had Tally and Kren, the stars of the weirdest buddy-wizard movie ever, on the battlefield, and cast Krenko's Command, I'd be getting 5 1/1 goblins and 2/2 flying drake for 1R. C-c-c-c-c-combo! I proudly brought my concoction to a local FNM, where my Krenko was countered, my Talrand was speared, and I learned what a Thragtusk is, and why casting Unsummon (a value spell) on it is bad. \n However, I did get props from the regulars for maindecking Spelltwine in a Standard tournament. \n I didn't have a lot of money to spend on singles, but I knew I wanted to keep improving my deck. My big level up moment at the FNM had been about impacting board state. Krenko was a sitting duck until you untapped with him, but right after casting Talrand, you could cast another spell and immediately get a drake. Value! My plan was in place. The goblin had to go. \n I went online and looked up cards that had the words \"instant or sorcery\" in the text box. I figured, Talrand cares about these kinds of cards, so I should find other creatures that do too. Apparently Flashback was a thing? I found a card called \"Snapcaster Mage\" which was weird. I had no idea why a cyborg was holding a super-soaker in gothic Germany. But whatever! I'll roll with it. At eighty bucks a pop, there was no way I was going to be able to afford a playset, so I figured Okay. Talrand will be my snapcaster mage. Because both give you extra value out of instants and sorceries. They're BASICALLY the same card. \n I found another card that seemed pretty unimpressive but interacted with spells so I threw it in there. A wee one-drop called Delver of Secrets. Then I packed the deck full of counter magic, tempo, and burn. \n By this point, Return to Ravnica had dropped, and it was clear to me that the two most powerful cards in the set were goblins, my favorite creature type. Goblin Electromancer and Guttersnipe. Holy planeswalkers, Batman. Going back to my original deck. It occurred to me that with Talrand and my three muskegoblins on the battlefield I could cast Krenko's Command...for (R)... get 7 1/1 goblins, a 2/2 flying drake, AND do two damage to my opponent? VALUE. CITY. \n As I became more in love with Magic, I learned a sad and horrible truth. Talrand was not basically the same card as Snapcaster Mage. You see, Talrand was cheap...because he was expensive. And in a brutal Standard environment with plentiful removal, I had been evicted from Value City. \n I tightened up my list. Goodbye goblins. Goodbye Talrand. Another card I'd seen that cared about instants and sorceries, Augur of Bolas, came in. Time passed. I played with other decks, but I kept running the old UR Tempo list. Sometimes I called it the Pink Deck (named for the sleeves I used) or Izzet Delver. \n Around the time that M14 came out, I was watching old tournaments pretty frequently. I went back to Pro Tour Dark Ascension. Apparently, some other people had realized if you put the bald blue Jeff Goldblum one-drop in a deck with a bunch of counterspells, the results were pretty good. Who knew! \n And then... M14 spoilers... Young Pyromancer. It was a red Talrand... and a two-drop! Perfect for my curve. Turn 1. Delver. Turn 2. Pyromancer. Turn 3. A twelve-week stay in VALUE TOWN! \n By rotation, I had assembled a pretty nasty little deck. Of course it hurt without the totally broken Ponder, but it was still a blast to play: flying over the heads of Loxodon Smiters, bum rushing Domri Rade with elemental tokens, totally hosing the Aristocrats with a couple of Thundermaw Hellkites I had stuck in as finishers. I wanted to win as much as I could with my beloved creation. I was going to lose basically the whole deck when rotation happened. I wouldn't even be able to put Talrand and Krenko back in. It was to be the end of an era. But I still have hope. Pyromancer is still there, looking for a home that isn't a throw-fire-in-your-face deck. In the next set, we get Keranos, the blue-red god. Who knows what will happen! \n A few weeks before rotation, I 4-0ed a standard daily on MTGO with the deck. In the finals I faced a guy running the elf/garruk deck and blew him out with izzet staticaster. Before he conceded, he wrote in the chat \"How does it feel to run terrible cards and have it work out?\" \n It feels pretty good. [summary]: "}

He's nice, respectful, he gets along with all my friends, just everything is pretty much perfect. \n Except his finances.

He likes to gamble playing pool from time to time.  Since we have started dating, he's not up there late at night when the gambling usually starts, so that has decreased.  He does pay most of the time when we go out.  I pay here and there, but it's always when I offer to.  I also know how he gets paid now and can figure out when he's struggling financially and when he has money..... \n His car.....ugh....his car.

Started to pull out of the parking spot and hit someone else.  Then somehow he sideswiped something else a little while later.  What resulted is him having a nice car with a lot of damage.  He can't afford the three deductibles his insurance company wants him to pay to fix his car, so for now he has ductape holding his car together.  It's embarassing.  Honestly, it is.

I asked him outright what was going on, but we were on our way to meet up with some friends so he just told me he would tell me later. \n I told him that money is a dealbreaker subject for me.  My last relationship, I wound up supporting my ex for a year.  I told him I'm not getting in that boat again.  I have a career.  I make decent money.

He lives in Canada and I live in the US, we are both citizens of our respective countries of residence. \n Important Background \nMy partner does not have an easy life, he has moved far away from his third-world family, country, and life to excel as a scientist and reach his potential.  He sends part of his salary home to support his elderly widowed mother.  His mother was cared for in a more day=to- day sense by his unemployed brother, so while my partner was supporting them financially, the bother was taking care of her in other ways. \n The Issue \nMy partner flew back home because his brother was having some health problems, which we now find are very serious, and have become debilitating.  Medical care in their home country is dreadful.  As a result, my partner has now resolved that he must move his mother and brother to where he lives as soon as the brother is stable enough to travel.  There is really no hope for the brothers recovery back home, even if it is just because there is really no one to help take care of him.  (For reasons I don't completely understand the mother and brother are very isolated from the extended family there). \n My Question \nNow, I know what this means.  The plan to move to our new jobs together is off, and he will just make the best he can with his life where he is so he can take care of his mother and brother. I feel this leaves me with what feels like an impossible decision: leave my career, my own family and friends, my whole life to live in Canada where not a single job is available for me within a 500 mile radius of where he lives (been checking for months).  Or leave this poor man, whom I love, alone and to care for his family. \n I strongly feel this needs to transcend the normal knee-jerk relationship advice of \"just have a good conversation with him and find a compromise, if you can find a compromise then move on.\"  For one thing, I know he isn't even thinking about our future right now.  He is in war-mode making sure his mother and brother are taken care of now and in the immediate future, and have a DTR right now is probably not a good idea.

{"input_text": "Hey guys, here's the thing. I grew up with Zelda games on the NES, SNES and Gameboy in the 90s when I was a kid and had a blast. Then I became PC gamer, didn't touch console games for 20 years until recently. I got Ocarina of Time 3D for the 3DS and bought the Windwaker HD Wii U bundle. I barely touched both games. I keep trying to get into them, capture that Zelda charm I was fond of as a kid, but it just won't click. The dungeons feel stale, the gameplay too simple and I don't have a smile on my face when interacting with NPCs/the world like I used to as a kid. I must admit, being over 30 and having played a ton of video games since the late eighties, only few games are able to get my attention nowadays. But why no Zelda - oh whyyyy? Nintendo always produces quality with its main franchises. Zelda games still get top reviews, but maybe I am expecting too much. [summary]: "}
{"input_text": "Disclaimer: I'm using a throwaway because the people in this story reddit (because of course they do we work in tech) and I don't want them to know my username. \n I'm a woman who works at a startup in Silicon Valley in a technical/engineering type role. \n Earlier this week I had a meeting with a vendor whose product I am considering using for a project of mine. The sales rep I talked to was bafflingly condescending, to the point of talking...slowly...so...I..would...understand. He suggested we schedule another meeting so I could \"bring an engineer\" with me. \n So obviously I was angryconfused, but I was also very tired (see: startup) so I just agreed because I wanted the conversation to be over and hey: maybe he'd bring an engineer too so I'd have someone more useful to talk to? \n I honestly wasn't entirely sure what to make of it. Was this guy being sexist, or just dense? So, I went back to my desk and told the story to my coworkers. Hint: They are who this post is actually about. \n My team (yes, all dudes) recognized immediately that by \"bring an engineer\" the other guy meant \"I'm a sexist ass.\" I was so very gratified by the looks of wide-eyed shock and anger on their faces, and by their immediate responses: \n \"He said WHAT!?\" \n \"Um, did you tell him you ARE an engineer?\" \n \"Can  I  go to this meeting so I can overtly and repeatedly defer to you on all points?\" \n It was suggested that I bring not just one engineer, but my whole team should go to the meeting so they could  all  sit quietly and pointedly defer to me on all things. While that would be hilarious, and possibly even make the sexist guy realize he was being made fun of (and why), it's not really my style. (You may have correctly deduced by now that I am not highly confrontational.) \n So I brought one other person to the next meeting. My 'engineer' did a fantastic job of speaking only when spoken to, and then only to deflect questions back to me by saying things like \"well, that's more throwawaytechlady's area of expertise\". \n Fortunately, the other guy had brought an engineer with him as well! He (vendor's engineer) was super helpful and we ended up having a fruitful meeting. Followup emails to me have all come from the engineer-guy. All in all, a win. [summary]: "}

This doesn't mean I give handouts to anyone. \n If someone I know has a good work ethic, and I know would be a good fit for a job, than I'll refer them. If you are looking to just milk a company for money, than no. \n My girlfriend works as a tutor in a learning center she doesn't make much money, in fact most of her friends don't either.

One thing that I will say is she is pretty, a diasdvantaged minority, and also had a really friendly/warm personality, and currently she was working at the front desk of a gym, making $10 an hour. \n Over time getting to know her I realized that she was a good person, I asked her if she was looking for a new job she said she would be interested. I had a friend who worked as a talent director, and I referred Jessica to him.  She ended up getting the interview and shortly after getting a job. His company is looking to have a more diverse candidate pool, and she was a great pick for the team. \n Things were all good, her friends said that if a new position opens up that to look out for them too, my girlfriend as well basically said the same thing.

{"input_text": "The Spark\" is just a biochemical reaction propagated by the brain. To say you can't acquire \"the spark\" is absolute rubbish. All you have to do is follow basic scientific proven ideals of attraction, such as facial and body symmetry (showing long term health and good genes), muscle definition (to show you can protect your partner), waist to hip ratio (for babies), skin tone (as in you look glowing today rather than race, pastey is deemed to be ill in most cases), smelling nice (people inherently associate bad smells with disease) and many other things, which really in laymen's terms, is being attractive. \n This can easily be achieved through the use of make up, though normally frowned upon in men, in women it is often used to make the eyes larger (mascara and eye liner), reduce blemishes in the skin to increase symmetry (Concealer, Foundation, skin scrubs, soap etc.), enhance lip colour and can also be used to enhance other areas of the body through shadowing and lightening. As wells as through having a hair style that suits the way your hair grows or you can just artificially controlling your hair with straighteners/curlers and wax/gel/spray. \n Maybe you can't make a spark with the specific person you want to but it really isn't hard to create a spark with someone in a random group of 100 people otherwise no one would ever date or marry anyone. \n But if you know the person fairly well and you can even adapt your dress sense to the styles they like. This can be achieved quite easily by looking at the celebrities they like or activities they do, as well as enhancing your assets, such as with padded bras for women and tight clothes for athletic men, while in the other cases downplaying some of your less features for instance looser clothes if you aren't of an athletic build or corsets if it is deemed as acceptable dress for the occasion. \n You can also aim your body type and style towards the type of person you are interested in. For instance, a person who does a lot of outdoor activities will like a more athletic style of body than someone who is a musician, when an average of these populations of people is taken. Also in this vain you can join activities that they also enjoy such as jogging, cycling, dancing, cooking or anything that they do, even if you didn't think you would enjoy doing it; you might find you do with them due to you enjoy their company and this may change your way of thinking. \n The spark can also be \"faked\" just by being interested in people and adapting to body language signals therefore avoiding topics the other person may not be comfortable talking about and only talking about positive subjects and ideas, this will lead to an association between you as a person and happy thoughts and memories. \n All this can only really be achieved while being fairly average in the first place and then adapting yourself to be attractive to the subgroup of the population you are interested in, the rest is just understanding social cues and having interesting things to talk about with the other person, which can easily be faked if you have spent enough time listening to boring people while having to seem interested in what they are saying (just think of those fun office conversations). Also in the case of the level of patience required for the relationship this can also be ascertained by understanding body language and inflections on messages to comprehend their state of mind and how they feel about the relationship and can be \"faked\" if you choose too. \n A lot of dating isn't dumb luck, you date people you are physically attracted too (if you don't, you are doing it wrong) and therefore select them from a group (we can all think of people we would never date, people who we might and people we would at the drop of a hat), this attraction can be because they are your \"type\" or because you like your idea of their personality and have idolised it and therefore finding you are attracted to common things that they do, just because they are doing them, rather than them being anything special. \n No one is going on dates with people they don't like, unless it is for the benefit of a friend, physical attraction is the original basis of most relationships, however much anyone tries to tell you otherwise. You didn't fall in love with that other random person sitting across from you in class because of their great personality you did it because you thought they looked good and then idolised their personality ignoring any faults they may have before you got to know them (assuming you ever did). \n To claim you can't acquire \"The spark\" goes against the whole materialisticness of human culture and this isn't just in the clothes you wear to fit in with a group, be that Metal, Hipster, Smart-casual, your work suit, all which aims to make you attractive to the style of partner you want, as well as your hair style (more so in your teens and 20's before you have to look professional for work, doctors are frowned upon with mohawk's) and any jewellery you might wear. For example, fancy watches to look rich, necklaces, which symbolise all types of social class and group when worn, just think of a gold chain versus a string of wooden beads, also earrings, piercings and even your phone say things about you that can be deemed as attractive or unattractive and be modified to suit your target audience. This can also be achieved in a cost effective manner by buying fake versions when no one can tell the difference. \n Personally faking it seems like way to much effort to me as you will have to admit who you really are at some point, so unless you actually were interested in the activities, conversations and lifestyle and just didn't have anyone to share them with in the first place it probably isn't going to go well (especially if you have presented yourself as very wealthy and aren't). Unless of course they end up liking you for who you really are in the end (and you end up liking them after you stop idolising their personality), but the real world isn't some Disney film so don't count on it.

We've had A LOT of ups and downs, a lot of fighting, and a lot of getting back together and trying to fix our problems. Even when everyone else in my life didn't understand why I was still trying to make things work with him, I did. Because despite our problems I always wanted to keep trying. I do love him. \n But I should get to the point, he has anger issues. We have huge fights over really stupid stuff, really small things can set him off. For the first few years of our relationship I took part in these fights, allowed him to push my buttons, yelled back, etc. This last year or so though I finally decided we couldn't just keep doing the same thing. Our fights were almost scripted, he would get upset and something I said or did, I would be appalled that he was so irrationally upset by something so minor and I would defend myself. Defending myself would be viewed as telling him he was wrong and all hell would break loose. Repeat the next week. I tried changing my role in the fights, stopped letting him push my buttons as much, started trying to literally leave the situation when it reached a certain point, etc., \n I think I'm finally waking up though. Even though some things have been getting better and I feel like he has been working on showing me more love and affection I think I've lost all hope that the fights will stop.

He is able to forget all of the love that we've shared and scream really hurtful things at me over something incredibly stupid. (Ex. Friday's fight was over how you measure the complexity of games and he ended up yelling and cussing at me while we had friends over) \n I want us to work, I just don't have any hope that we'll be able to change the pattern.

Good times. \n Season 2 was fun. We had the meta and although it had its haters it was generally accepted and the game went on. \n A game I play on March 8, 2013 got me thinking about what we expect from other players. I'm on a goal to reach platinum and treat every game seriously. I end up laning against a 2-0 Rengar with 1st blood from an early invade as irelia. Ok, whatever I'll just farm and survive. I do. I actually end up with about a 30cs lead at 15min. \n As I am pushing top lane I notice Rengar on the bottom of the map. I decide to push the first top tower, and work on the 2nd one. Rengar scores a double kill. \n Everything changes now. Three people on my team begin to call me out, and in a quite explicit manner. I tell them I thought the best move was to keep pushing, as it was unlikely I would make the fight. This of course does not matter to them, and I am now the sole reason we will lose the game. All of the other lanes losing in cs and kills gets completely discarded. I get reported by all 3. \n I'm not saying that I was right to push down 2 towers instead of walking all the way bot to help in the fight. Perhaps this was my mistake. BUT this community and game has gotten to the point where mistakes or individual judgments are not tolerated. \n Suppose it was Voyboy who decided to push down the top two towers, and that was actually the optimal play for the team. Well since your teammates, let's say they are Silver V, decided that you were wrong and are not cooperating with team, you get reported. \n It's a team game, I know, but individual judgments cannot simply be punished by referring to the \"refusing to communicate\" tribunal report. Apparently my judgement that it was better to take 2 towers instead of roaming bot is now a reportable offense under this category of report. This got me thinking about what the community expects from every player... \n The community is basically requiring a program-like series of actions from every player, every game. Ever try to use clarity, clairvoyance, or revive in a game? Reported. Every try to use an unconventional top like Taric in <1600 elo? Must be huge troll - reported.

I just put it under makeup maybe once a week and that's it. \n Then I started reading reddit and saw people mention so many different things, it made my head spin. I decided to choose one thing at random and try. I chose Witch Hazel (Dickinson's Original Witch Hazel  They had it on amazon, but then I notced a regular drug store, Walgreens, had it so I could avoid shipping. \n I bought 2 - an original one and I saw one for specifically oily skin. I've been using the original one for a couple months now and it DID make a difference! I swipe my face with a watered cotton pad in the morning & evening and after that I put the Witch Hazel on a new pad and use it on my face all over. \n It didn't happen right away, but a couple weeks in I have noticed my face is less oily by the afternoon. YES, it is still oily, but less so. Plus sometimes I don't use it twice a day so that could be the reason. Its enough difference for me to keep using it, and I am not going to buy/try anything new and stick with this. \n I've also noticed when I feel acne forming (like under my skin, and you cant see it yet) it sometimes goes away before breaking through the skin into a zit - that rarely happened before the witch hazel. When I get pimples, they are on my face for a shorter amount of time now. Maybe a week VS weeks of having a splotch. \n The experience that made me post this, and be sure this stuff really works on me is the following. I wax parts of my face with Sallie's prewaxed face strips, and EVERY single time, I always got little bumps and acne on the area. I used the oil that came with the wax, so I dont know if the oil would do that to my skin or what. But couple days ago, I waxed, used the oil, and then used Dickinson's witch hazel and my skin is PERFECTLY smooth. No bumps, etc. This NEVER happened before and I've been waxing my face with these strips for years. \n Anyway, huge [summary]: "}
{"input_text": "My name is irrelevant, but it is important for me to lay out who people think I am. \n I am mid-30s, and a respected member of the community I reside in. I receive awards, CEOs love me, I help people, and I make decent money at it too \u2014 completing the image with an expensive car. I have the facade down. I help people with their image, so I'm damn good at crafting my own. \n .......I've never done this before, but shrouded in a throwaway I will tell a part of my story. \n I excelled at school in my early years, and was an A + B student up until we got the internet when I was 15. This bright kid then found the quicksand that occupied my life for the past 19 years. \n I can't believe it has been that long. This was almost 20 years ago, that I discovered internet porn. \n It enveloped me. I stayed up many many nights masturbating. I printed out pictures, made a binder of cyber sex I was having, I was head over heels involved in this feeling I never felt before, in a life that had strict religious overtones. I was taught that Sex is smut. Sex is bad. Gay is wrong. Pleasure is wrong. So, when I discovered otherwise, that sex is not evil. Sex is beautiful, and humans are sexually sophisticated creatures - a conflict erupted. Then yet another confusing twist to reality : I'm bi. I have two polar attractions. By acknowledging this within myself I tried to shut off the gay side frequently and medicated my depression that this caused, with masturbation. I medicated my depression with masturbation, but even still masturbated switching between gay porn and straight porn. Dogfart. Titan. AolChat rooms. Xvideos. PornHub. \n I look back now, and it has affected my entire life. When I was 15 I dropped out of honors classes, and started taking academic classes. I only passed by scoring high marks on my tests, offsetting my lack of homework. Because, I was masturbating. One night when I was 17 I stayed up all night masturbating, and was so exhausted the next morning that I fell asleep at the wheel causing a major traffic accident. I nearly went through my windshield and injured a family so badly they sued me. We settled out of court for nearly $200,000. \n In college, I never got any degrees, instead I wasted my parents money just coasting through it with whatever intellect I had. Realizing my greatest strength was networking, I became friends with students and faculty until I got a job offer that lead me to start my own company. Why did I not work harder? I was too depressed at who I was, caving under the stress of self-imposed shame. I was bullied throughout school-even through college, and this combined with my sexual identity confusion, I kept medicating myself.  In my job, I often wait until the last day to do a project because of self-doubt. The chief contractor is the only motivator, and I would often freak out that I waited until the last minute. But, that stress didn't matter because I could always go to my office for a \"conference call\" and rub one out to make me feel better.. \n This past summer, I was right to be depressed because I was dealing with a confused sexual identity, and diminished attraction to my girlfriend. I was more interested in porn and the possibility of NoStringsAttached sex I could have with girls & guys, and this caused me to break down. I was deeply deeply confused. So, I turned to a therapist to help. She diagnosed me with adult ADHD, and while I believe that is correct, it is only partially correct. \n Discovering this Sub-Reddit, I read signs of others addicted to self-pleasure, and I realized how my addicted brain put a blind spot over this issue. I've been going through therapy for nearly half a year and this addiction never came up. I didn't see it... I am a functional addict. \n I have ADHD and I'm also addicting to Fapping. \n I could go on further, in greater detail about how every relationship I've had has ended with me preferring it have sex by myself, or to a recent spike in substance abuse, all the way to PMO (I see the acronym as Personally Medicating Oneself) making me less accountable to a tremendous life I could be living. \n However, I know all of NoFap. I see the accountability and the strengths people have gained, and still, last night, I pulled yet another allnight session. Watching 1.2 gigs of streamed content. \n I've lost 50+ pounds before (gained most of it back), quit drinking for 4 years, but I don't know how to stop this. I have a boss breathing down my neck for something to show him today, tomorrow is group work for most of the day, and then partaking in a meditation workshop tomorrow night. \n I am definitely a loner, and only wish to depend on my therapist if need be. I have a girlfriend that I broke up with recently who I told of the addiction, but she doesn't know this to be as deep as you now know. \n I feel that when I change, I will be a better person so that I don't feel shamefully hollow. I see how much time I waste in life, as evidenced by the high school level of writing I have. \n I'm better than this, I tell myself, but I know what's easier to do... I've been doing that for 2/3 of my life. [summary]: "}

{"input_text": "A point I see many some people bringing up in defense of Squirtle is that it is able to be used to solo the game, meaning use of it as your only Pokemon. I believe that ability to solo the game should have very little effect on the outcome of the discussion. If anything the ability for a Pokemon to synergize with other Pokemon is much more important than the ability to solo the game. Pokemon is meant to be played with a team of 6 Pokemon that you get to know and love, not one over-worked turtle-squirrel hybrid that might disobey you because you have leveled him too high. Both Charmander and Bulbasaur synergize better with other pokemon, as Bulbasaur starts with both grass and poison type, offering more type coverage than the pure water Bulbasaur. Charmander will later evolve into the fire and flying type Charizard, while Squirtle will stay as a pure water type throughout his evolutionary chain. \n As well, Venusaur is the grass type with the highest stats out of both red and blue. Although Arcanine does have higher stats than Charzard, it loses the dual typing, and the increase is minimal. Moltres also has higher stats than Charzard and the duel typing, but it can only be caught after beating the elite four. There are two water types that have high stats than Blastoise (Gyrados and Lapras), and they have duel typing as well. One is literally given to you for free, and the other has a pre-evolution up for sale for 500 PokeDollars in the Pokemon Centre just before Mt. Moon. This shows how easily replaced Squirtle is, and how there is nothing quite like a Bulbasaur or a Charmander \n And finally, some weird squirrel-turtle hybrid is no where near as cool as a Dinosaur or a lizard from japanese folklore that can grow wings and fly.

However, his life was spared when he was discovered pale and emaciated by some passing Shoanti tribesmen of the Skoan-Quah (Skull Clan). Struck by the child's predicament - to be so frail and yet still cling to what little life he had - and emboldened by the favoured omen of vultures circling overhead, the tribesmen adopted Borsh to raise as their own.\n> \n> As Borsh grew up among the Shoanti, his orcish ancestry became increasingly apparent. As the elders were suspicious of his tainted heredity, the other children were free to ridicule and bully him with impunity. When he was seven, Borsh lost his left eye to a routine stoning. Later, when the other youths were made adults, he was given the full name of Beet-Eater; a mock honorific he had earned for subsisting on a diet of mostly rotten vegetables.\n> \n> When a small sect of Charon-worshippers broke away from the quah, so did Borsh. Among the cultists, Borsh was allowed to grow strong. He was given flesh to eat. He was encouraged to explore his darker impulses. When tribesmen from neighbouring clans were captured, Borsh was instrumental in their torture and inevitable death. To celebrate his new life, he took the unholy symbol of a grinning skull upon his chest, its eye sockets covered by two golden coins.\n> \n> Unfortunately for Borsh, the sect was short-lived. A party of do-gooding adventurers happened upon the cultists' enclave and effectively relieved Charon of his disciples. Borsh barely managed to escape with his life.\n> \n> Enraged and once more displaced, Borsh followed the adventurers to a nearby city. A score of the local guard managed to subdue him - but not until after Borsh had exacted his revenge. He was summarily charged and imprisoned on four counts of exacerbated manslaughter including two counts of decapitation. To date, one of the victims' arms has yet to be recovered and many believe it may have been eaten.\n> \n> After five years of incarceration, Borsh was declared rehabilitated and released on probation. He now works as a competent albeit somewhat temperamental potter's assistant. \n With respect to getting Borsh to join the party, coming up with a good hook should prove fairly simple. However, I'd be tickled if it had something to do with a brawl over some broken pottery. \n So, any thoughts? [summary]: "}

Because the passion behind the song I heard on the tape makes me think that not only do these kids believe that nothing was wrong with the song, but that perhaps it showed how they really felt about people of another race all along.\" \n We could talk all day about racism, how prevalent it still is, how the digital age has moved people from being openly racist to using discretion, discretion that typically leads to them only sharing these beliefs with people who they believe feel the same way. \n It doesn't accomplish anything. It's not going anywhere. The point of all this is simple, as long as a predominately singular race believes themselves superior and act in accordance with that belief, people of color will never be free in America, or any where else in this world for that matter. Darker complected people have been persecuted in one way or another since as far back as history books go. \n Sorry for the soapbox [summary]: "}

He was a writer and a prof of post-mod lit so that was right up my alley. However, he was socially awkward but I mistook that for genius again. \n We talked for about 6 months online and over the phone till we met in person. I felt comfortable doing so but soon the first date was off. He couldn't control his volume and would shout instead of talking. I just thought he was autistic and as the aunt of an autistic, I didn't want to judge him of that. However, three dates in, it was just awful so I told him the old let's be friends line. \n So he started sending gifts. Books, flowers, a poem he wrote. I kept firmly telling him no but after weeks of this, I cut off contact. I even moved apartments at the time to a cheaper one and he had no idea where my new place was. \n That's when presents starting showing up at work. Only he had no idea where I worked I thought. He had to have stalked me to find it. It was in another city about 30 min away in a secure place as I worked for a company that did government contracts. I filed police reports. He still sent things. Then one day a package from Quebec came. I'm in Ohio so I opened it not sure who it was from. \n Tucked in a little jewelry box was a toe. I have never screamed so much in my life. It was blackish and the bone was sticking out but you could tell what it was. I called the cops. The guy was hospitalized soon after cutting his toe off. He DROVE to Quebec to cut and send his toe on purpose because he knew that I would open a package from there (one of my favorite places). He went away to a mental hospital and last I heard, went back to Moscow. \n No there was no sex. Everyone always asks that for some reason. I always joke that I don't know what would've happened had I done that with him.

{"input_text": "I know this comment looks long, but it's not really. Mind you, I'm assuming you're going with her reasoning and saying \"Saying you're an atheist is not the best logical position.\" If you're not saying that, then skip this comment! Cheers :) \n Assuming you'll forgive this foray into the issue here - people will disagree with me but this is the way I see it (having spent longer, I bet, than Coren thinking about it): \n That was one of the issues I had with the piece - she doesn't understand the position most atheists hold nor, I think, the nature of agnosticism with/versus atheism. \n There are two types of atheism: strong and weak. \n \n A strong atheist has the position: I believe there is no god (of any kind). \n \n A weak atheist has the position: I do not believe in a god (of any kind). \n \n \n The first is a positive claim - a claim to the truth of the situation/reality. With some gods it is actually possible to be a strong atheist with regard to that god - Actually the Christian god (as some claim) is one of those, [though the issue is debated]( \n Most  atheists, the vast majority, hold the weak position mainly because it is the response to a claim made by the religious. If no religious people existed, the claim: \"There is a god and it is X.\" would ever be made and consequently would never have to be responded to. The same way that you are an 'atheist' with regards to the Bumplewurzle (abumplewurzlist) when I tell you \"There is a Bumplewurzle\", you're not necessarily saying \"I believe there is no bumplewurzle\" but rather responding to my claim and saying: \"I do not believe this Bumplewurzle exists[because you have/I see no proof]\". \n This is entirely different from agnosticism, which concerns itself with whether or not you can know if a god (or something) exists. So you are correct in so far as you need faith for the Christian god and should be agnostic about it but it doesn't end there . Aside: though you'll notice that Christians around the world differ in their opinion with regards to the agnosticism aspect: I think you'll find a good many gnostic (they claim) Christians in various parts of America for example. In the UK they're probably a good deal rarer. \n So there are four possibilities, [outlined neatly in this graph linked.]( Of course, some people say \"I don't care\" but fuck 'em because they're cluttering up the place! :D \n A lot of people seem to avoid the label \"Atheist\" due to actions and claims of various groups over the years. It's really nothing to be scared of or worried about calling yourself, and far more people than admit it, or probably know, are atheists. My step father, for example, gets annoyed when I point out he is because he refuses the label. Mind you, he doesn't understand the above argument no matter how many times I explain it: \n Consider the question: Do you believe in a god, X or any god? \n If the answer is  anything  but \"Yes\", then you are an atheist (with regard to that god X etc.). That's it. Nothing more, nothing less: it doesn't mean you're in love with Dawkins, it doesn't mean you campaign for this group or that, it doesn't mean you're immoral or lack empathy, it doesn't mean you wish bad things on others: It just means you do not accept the claim that a god, X, or any god, exists. Just like any other (mythical) thing you've ever heard or not heard about. \n Whether or not you can  know  that, is another matter entirely. \n Personally I'm an agnostic atheist. I think I know a couple of gnostic atheists, but they've not convinced me. [summary]: "}

{"input_text": "Here is my story and I am so happy right now that I have to share it and I want to know other peoples stories. \n Okay for some background: \n My Dad is a hardass marine. Stubborn beyond belief and hard headed. It was always hard to talk to him about any problems because if something went wrong that he didn't like it would just turn into him yelling at everyone. Ever since I was a kid I would just not talk to him unless spoken to because I didn't know what to say that wouldn't piss him off. He was never abusive to me or my mom physically, just mostly emotionally because he'd blow his lid about everything. I hated that about him because I am the type of person that wants to solve problems. I have many friends that are still my friends because I could mediate a solution but I could never do that with my Dad because he would always get so defensive and tune everyone out. His favorite thing is to yell as loud as he can so nobody else can say anything back. My mom is a very passive person and I was passive as a kid so it worked every time, we'd just shut up so he'd stop yelling. \n Well today I am 21 years old and I don't put up with people yelling at me. I flew into California where my parents live a week ago to visit them for the summer. This morning, He was yelling at my mom over the phone like he does all the time now (they are getting divorced finally so tensions are high) and for the first time I figured I would get confrontational. I texted him that he's being a jerk. This is the first time I've ever done it because I'm usually pretty non-confrontational and I just let things take their course until the situation calms down. Today i said fuck it. So he calls me and says how dare I call him a jerk and take my moms side. I told him that I am not taking any sides but yelling at someone is being a jerk. He talk for a second I tell him to stop yelling he says he's just talking loudly so I just continue until I tell him to calm down (I know telling someone to calm down never works but hey, worth a shot.) He gets super pissed and starts screaming over the phone, now usually this is the solution that makes my mom stop talking. Fuck that , my balls grew 10 times their size that moment, he hasn't talked to me like this is a long time. I scream louder than him and tell him to listen to me. He actually stops yelling, nobody has every stood up to this before. I tell him he is being stubborn and continue trying to tell him that his relationship with Mom is partly his fault. He doesn't take criticism very well either so that makes him blow up again but this time he hangs up before I can get him to shut up. \n This is his second tactic, end the conversation and leave so he doesn't have to face it and after a while just comes back pretending all is well like nothing ever happened. I know this too well so I text him because I know if I call he'd just hang up: \n \"I am not going to stop texting you until we work this out.\" \n 2nd text: \n \"I can't believe you won't call me back. Fine I'll spam hundreds of e-mails to you until you can talk to me\" \n 3rd text: \n \"I would quit college before I lose my own dad. Your stubbornness will not phase me in the slightest\" \n He calls back. Crying. I think that was awesome, something finally clicked with him to make him stop thinking the world is out to get him. We have a long heartfelt conversation. He keeps saying that he tries to work so hard so we can have everything he didn't have growing up. I tell him that it isn't about stuff like that, it's about him being a good person. Someone that I can talk to without feeling like they're going to blow up at any minute. Someone that will listen to my problems and help find a solution. This is the first time I have ever been able to talk to my Dad like this and it took until I was 21 to do it.

My dad had gone out so it was just me and my two siblings at my grandmas house, who had just passed away. \n I walked into the living room and my mom was shaking like fuck in her chair but because her and my sister, 16, had just argued and my sister stormed out I thought she was just trying to lighten the mood and be funny. I laughed, walked out of the room to grab a glass of water, came back and she was still shaking, only now blood was coming out of her mouth because she had bit her tongue. I called to my Bro, 11, and we both didn't know what was going on. We got my sister and yelled \"What did you do to mom!\" at her, and when she saw what was going on panicked as well. \n The only thing we could think to do was run outside and find some adults. We ran next door, crying and yelling, and no one was home. At some point my sister realized that she should call the ambulance, and me and my brother ran to the other neighbour and again, no one was home. \n We went back into the house hoping it had stopped, but it hadn't. We waited for the ambulance as we watched our mom convulse, bleed from her mouth and see her eyes slip back into her head. The ambulance showed up, it felt like forever. They had to wait until she stopped seizing, over 45 minutes later, to do much. In that time, my Dad had come home and the paramedics explained to us what was happening, and that she would be okay. \n When she woke up she was out of it. If you've ever seen someone some out of a bad seizure they seem drugged. The paramedics asked her questions, and she didn't have much memory. When they asked her who we were, the 3 children crying in front of her, she looked us blankly and said, \"I have no idea.\" Even with everything that had happened in the past hour, this is what scared me the most. \n In the grand scheme of things this isn't so bad.

{"input_text": "I agree with your observations. Our country (and some other countries out there) is going through a process of polarization in the religious arena. For some reason, the middle ground where balanced opinions and approaches and implementations used to reside is disappearing. Most groups (social, political, religious) are migrating to where opinions, approaches and implementarions are extreme. \n We are adopting a \"black-or-white\" view on everything. We are preferring attitudes of discrimination and rejection over attitudes of tolerance and inclusion. We are losing the ability to value diversity and profit from it. As a society, our vision is being reduced, narrowed by this way of thinking (black-or-white, all-or-nothing, with-me-or-against-me). \n This way of thinking, so narrow and discriminatory, belongs to religion. It is one of its signatures. By nature, religion has to differentiate between good and evil only. It is unable to consider the terrain in between with acceptance. In time, then, it is unavoidable that religion ends up polarizing the peoples under its influence. \n Of course, this phenomenon is not limited to mormonism, and the results are what we're witnessing here in America. We - as a nation - are being divided, becoming enemies among ourselves; and not because of other countries, or wars, or pivotal social issues, or political rivalries gone wrong... but by religion!

Now we have people with political power building their historical notions from religious books! \n It makes me think of the dark ages. For example, previously to the dark ages, it was known that the Earth was spherical, it was known that the moon was our satellite. The movement of the planets and stars were known and, from them, inquirying minds were able to discover truth for the benefit of human kind.

Therefore, you can't get a highly ordered thing like a human being out of nothing! \". \n Given that the second law expresses an overall trend in the universe that disorder should increase, or that overall order should decrease, doesn't that imply that complexity should reduce into simplicity?  Yet with the evolution of the Earth and its biosphere, we seem to see the opposite happening. \n In order to explain how life formed from a soup of relatively simple chemicals, do we have a good argument or an idea about how something so complex and information-rich as self-replicating DNA could form (spontaneously) from much simpler components? \n Furthermore, if DNA forms accidentally, how is it possible for it to form in such a way that it begins to develop a collaborative protein expression mechanic that in turn facilitates preservation and replication of the DNA? \n This seems like the opposite of the intuitive interpretation of the second law of thermodynamics ... That is, seemingly spontaneous trending toward very sophisticated order and machine-like complexity out of simplistic elements.  The theory of the natural (non-creationist) formation of life needs to argue that the universe can (and does inevitably) trend spontaneously toward highly sophisticated order -- at least in places, here and there, while still accomodating the second law of thermodynamics overall. \n So my question is really two questions: \n \n Are we prepared yet to posit what enables the formation of DNA from much simpler molecules? \n \n Is it plausible that there is anything like a natural law or a property of the universe that necessitates the formation of high order out of, essentially, almost nothing? \n \n \n Perhaps there is something deriving from the randomness quality of Quantum Mechanics?  (Anything that can happen will eventually happen;  And therefore, complex structures that have natural stability or even the ability to self-replicate will eventually inevitably occur, and by their stability, sustain themselves.  Once such structures occur, some of those structures will inevitably facilitate the growth of further complexity.) \n In other words, because the universe has a fundamental randomness at its core, stable structures will eventually form and complexity will necessarily evolve, progressively.

Now right away the main plot point is revealed that sends the PC on a epic adventure. Just like any DND campaign would start. Now you have an open world to explore and most DND players honestly will spend little time on the main quest unless there is nothing to do or they are being forced to. As a DM now all locations have basic layouts one or two rare items and just generic Baddies because Players want XP and Cash from a dungeon they dont want every single dungeon to have a quest line because that would get really annoying, where in fallout 4 it does the same thing because honestly if every location had a fullout story it would get tedious imo. Now with the minute men and becoming leader right away, PCs like power and being able to feel like they can make a difference in the world because as the DM i have to make the world revolve around them and as the DM having to play the role of every NPC i have a bias twards my PCs because they are indeed special. Now there are still some things that separate a DND campaign from Fo4 like Fo4 has alot more detail that a DM just has to come up with on the spot and Fo4 isnt a DND campaign its a Video game. So what im trying to say is next time your complaining that there a bunch of radiant quests or that everyone is so trusting of you, or that your just a god its because the game and all the NPCs secretly know you are not an NPC and want to make your game experience better. If you want it to not be like that, then why not play \"Post apocalyptic farming simulator\" or \"Diamond city guard simulator\" because most likely thats what you would be doing once you give up the wild goose chase for Shaun because anyone in their right mind would just think that raiders took him and hes long dead by now.

{"input_text": "Throwaway for obvious reasons. \n Last night while we were talking, my girlfriend of six months all of a sudden became upset for some reason. After trying for a while to ask her what was up, eventually she managed to spill the beans as to why. Essentially she told me that despite being the happiest she's ever been with me, she still sometimes feels it's easier for her to end it all. \n She hasn't had a good past and was screwed over by someone quite badly. Last year she suffered from depression until she moved town and met me and since then she's said she's never been so happy. However just before she met me, she was seriously contemplating suicide and later she admitted to me that when she met me, she had pills in her purse so she could OD. \n Thankfully she's been off depression pills and up to now she's been absolutely normal until last night when she mentioned about thinking it'll be easier to end it all. It was so out of the blue and sudden that I didn't really know how to react. I told her that I wouldn't know what to do but she just replied saying I'd be fine and I'd move on. \n I really don't know if I should take it further. Afterwards she was fine and this morning she was normal too, but I'm now terrified of the prospect of coming home to a note and her missing. I can't get her help because it didn't work in the past, and she'll be quite reluctant to talk about it. Up until now she's been wonderful but now after this I'm really concerned for her. I don't think she'd do it anytime soon and we've got so much planned over the next few months - including moving into our own flat in the summer. She's even been very adamant that she doesn't see herself with anyone else in the future and I agree with her, but her sudden outburst like that will be stuck in the back of my mind for a long time now.

{"input_text": "So, in the infinite wisdom of the galaxy far, far away from our own, they have discovered traveling at hyperspace speeds, miraculous medications and devastating weapons capable of destroying entire planets in a second. Among these inventions is a mail system that can, no matter which planet you visit deliver mail to any predetermined location on that planet including physical goods. Yet mysteriously every Sith from the aspiring Acolyte to the dreaded Darth must take a small amount of time out of their day to hunt down one of these technological innovations to retrieve  the bauble sent to them by an adoring fan. Does it not seem strange that the recluse of an Emperor that we have now would not have put the fear of a gruesomely painful death into the the division responsible for these wonders of technology if they did not come up with a way to get mail to the recipient no matter where they were on the planet or floating around in space on their ship? \n Another thing that doesn't make very much sense is a conversation I had with Vette the other day. I simply asked her to take all of the crafting materials from my inventory and place them in storage on my ship. She was highly confused, So I asked her \"You mean to tell me you can sort through my inventory determine what is not of any value and take it to a vendor and sell it, but yet are incapable of recognizing the crafting materials, which I have you use on a regular basis to make stuff and take those and store them safely on the ship?\" Unfortunately I lost some affection points for calling her stupid... \n Lastly, having dealt with my fair share of Hutts in my rise to a Lord of the Sith I find them exceptionally opportunistic and greedy.

{"input_text": "First of all just want to say its my first time on this subreddit. Now onto my rant. So I have been playing for about a month now. A friend who is in the higher rankings is showing me the ropes and says im doing quite well. I really enjoy this game. Reminds me of all the super smash bros as a kid. The thing I have a problem with is all the spammers and cheap tactics. By spamming I refer to people using the same move over and over. Some I know how to counter and it makes it too easy, while others I do not know how to counter yet and it becomes an easy win for them. I know that is more restricted to newer players though so I shrug it off generally. What really gets to me are the cheap tactics everyone seems to use. I am talking about throw spamming and weapon stealing. Throwing is very useful and I am not saying never use it, but don't make it your #1 move. This also plays into weapon stealing. This is a cheap tactic and no one can deny it. Easy win at lower rankings? Simple, just make sure you opponent never gets a weapon so you always do more damage. At the rankings I play at this sort of game play goes one of two ways: 1. you avoid them for a min or two until you finally get a weapon or 2. you try to do your best against them unarmed, and ultimately lose. I just want to fight fairly. When my opponent respawns I give leave them an open weapon and give them a moment to go get it. I feel like the game is just fun when you have a fair honorable fight. Lately the loss of hundreds of elo points and the constant spam has just left the game hollow. Sure its fun to do 2v2s when you have someone to help you fight against it, but 1v1s have just lost any fun for me. Quite frankly I am about to give up on this wonderfully fun game. Maybe I'm wrong, maybe that's just how its done on all levels nowadays. My friend has been around since the early days and says that is not the case. What do you all think? Is it worth trying to push through the spam for or should I just accept that the majority of players use these spammy tactics now? [summary]: "}

Move in together this summer, get engaged in a year and a half and so on. \n So he just got a new career and with it he's being shipped 800 miles away from me for 6 months.

{"input_text": "RE: the point about American flavors and \"a lot of everything.\" This definitely rings true far beyond hot sauces. Take American beers, for example. With IPAs, it's which beer can be the hoppiest. So bitter and floral that only the most accomplished palate can enjoy it. Or porters/stouts... they have to be the broodiest, roastiest, darkest beers. \n In college I had some friends who subscribed to this idea that hoppy beer = good beer and anything that wasn't as hoppy as whatever they were drinking was bad beer. It definitely felt competitive. Which is silly of course, because taste is relative. \n More to the point, though, I think beer labels could be an interesting side-note to the idea that American hot sauce labels reflect American culture. IMO, beer labels are far more diverse than hot sauce labels. Even super hoppy IPAs don't necessarily advertise them. Usually the labels favor the aesthetic qualities of that particular brand. E.g. the trippy labels of Magic Hat. Or the blocky labels of Drakes. \n Perhaps this is because beer breweries generally have many different styles of beers on the market at once, so there's more importance to brand recognition.

You have to realize that you will need to adapt your mechanics when you go outside- everybody has to adapt in the wind.

{"input_text": "Okay, first time poster, long time lurker so forgive lack of brevity or other mistakes. Back when I was about 22 I went on vacation with my family like we do every year, except this time we invited our first cousins who were really close with (2 older boys, sister is youngest). The little sister was 18 at the time and was very shy (still is) but I was pretty close with her and her closest in age brother, my cousin who was 20 at the time. I ended up going to the beach house with my mom and sister before anybody else because my brothers and dad had work. We invited my younger female cousin, Ashley, to come too since her brothers and parents couldn't make it till the weekend. She surprisingly said yes (she was/is really shy remember) so we left on a Wednesday morning. The car ride was spent with my mom and I talking and trying to include Ashley, but she mostly listened and laughed. I could tell she thought I was the fun older cousin, but was still the youngest in my family just like her. We stopped at the grocery store 30 minutes from the beach house to stock up on groceries like usual. Her and I had our assigned list of items to get so we walked around the store joking and catching up. Nothing flirtatious, just cousin talk. Since about three years before this she had started filling out and having some breasts and that tight teen butt, but I didn't really think of her like that yet. Mostly just observing the change. We got to the beach house and spent the first two days doing everything together alone because both our sets of siblings hadn't arrived except for my much older sister who kept to herself. \n I didn't think of it as really weird until we went in the jacuzzi one afternoon and she just looked incredible. (She is so shy and modest that she hadn't gone swimming with us cousins since she was 13) It suddenly hit me that my cousin was a hot babe. She was about 5'4\", sandy brown/blonde hair, trim build with some perky full B cup breasts with blue eyes. In the hot tub she wore a blue and black roxy bikini that made me get erect as soon as she lifted her leg over the edge to get inside and I saw that amazing spread between her legs. I acted normal and told myself to stop being gross but i was subconsciously really turned on by her now. After the jacuzzi I went to read in one of the bedrooms and she joined in with a book next to me. nothing sexual, but my sister walked in and made a big fuss as if she saw us kissing, which we both laughed at. \n That night my dad got in and he came with my mom to tell me that what I've been doing is inappropriate and that I need to act like an adult and make sure I'm never alone with her for sake of anything appropriate happening. They told me it was obvious she has a cousin crush but I cannot let anything happen. \n This made me get sick to my stomach because of the reality that it was THAT obvious and others had noticed. At the same time I was also incredibly turned on that she liked me. The next night I was laying on a pull out bed downstairs watching a movie with my Ashely's closest in age brother (my male cousin), and Ashley asked if she could join. The movie was Limitless, and there's that one sex scene in the beginning that was about to happen. I said sure and she crawled in bed and turned over and put her hand on my chest to watch the movie that was on my lap. Her brother saw and didn't care because he figured its just platonic cousin affection. The sex scene happened and I put my arm around her and she didn't say anything but pulled me a little closer. Her brother was pretty focused on the movie and didn't notice. We stayed like this for a while longer until an hour in and both of them were falling asleep. I began rubbing her back and she cooed. I put my hand under her shirt and started going up and down rubbing her smooth warm back until I felt her bra strap and pulled on it as a joke. She woke up a little but just cooed again. This went on for a bit more until the movie ended and her leg brushed my erection. I was going crazy trying to think if it was purposeful or not. The next day we were watching TV with all our siblings and I was next to her on the couch. A blanket was over us and I began rubbing her leg. She smiled and I continued going higher and higher, feeling the warmth and humidity increase. When I was an inch or two from feeling her outside lips (and i could already feel palpable wetness) she put her hand down and stopped me. We did this for about 30 minutes till her brother noticed something weird and made a joke about me liking her, which was super awkward and I steered clear the rest of the trip. \n Fast forward 2 months and I am at her house leaving to go back to mine to work with my dad and its early in the morning. She's still in bed upstairs and I go over to say goodbye (not weird to do). She's wearing a tank top without a bra exposing her slender, supple B cupped figure and wearing short soffie shorts that exposed the bottom of her rounded ass cheek. I kinda wake her up and she pulls my hand so I get into bed next to her halfway. I say bye and start tickling her a bit and she begins laughing and squirming. I get ballsy and begin tickling her legs with the forceful attempt to get to her pussy, she kinda catches on and laughs louder but keeps lightly grabbing my hand. I get chicken and stop and give her a hug goodbye. \n Since then its been pretty PG with her, I'm 24 now and she's 20 and lives at home still going to community college. She looks hotter than ever and has no interest in me sexually I don't think. I've sent her some drunken texts with winky faces but nothing obvious. she's always responded kinda flirty but not really. I'm tempted to tell her, or do more, but I'm unsure. I've mentioned some memories from that year at the beach house like boogie boarding and she said she doesn't remember it well. She doesn't drink often right now being under her parent's roof and we are Rarely alone. She has had a couple boyfriends but it sounds like they didn't go farther than second base. I have had six girlfriends since I was 13 and date often, I've mentioned stuff about my phsyical intimacy with girls to her on occasion, but she either laughs/judges me/kinda interested. Again she's shy so its tough. SO, do I do anything? If so what and when. Sorry is the story was long and anticlimactic, but I did warn you. It just kills me every time I'm over there getting a boner staring at her in short shorts, wearing tight shirts or tank tops with the nice figure she has. Her oldest brother and her are close and are physical in terms of laying next to each other but I don't think anything has happened. He jacked off in the same room as me once and thought i was asleep, so I wouldn't put it past him to maybe do something to her/in front of her. [summary]: "}
{"input_text": "Hello /r/darksouls, I come to you with a problem of mine that I could use some help with. You see, I have so far enjoyed the pvp-aspect of this game quite a lot, but... it is just so that I pretty much always get my ass handed to me. \n I spent a fair amount of time invading (darkwraith) /duelling in Anor Londo, with varying success, but it was only when I reached Kiln that I realized how much me and my character suck compared to others. \n Currently my dear wraith only has a SL of 105, (aiming for 120 or 125 I suppose) of which most points have been put into Strenght. It is my first character and I did not really know where to put what, thus decided that I want to try a strenght-build. The stats are as follows; \n Vitality: 28\nAttunement: 12\nEndurance: 31\nStrenght: 67\nDexterity: 16\nResistance: 12\nIntelligence: 9\nFaith: 11 \n Now, the weapon I use is a Demon Great Axe+15 which scales \"S\" in STR  (also tried a Machete+15), and with most of my points put into strenght it nets me 677 AR. With this comes great sacrifice in other stats, and has limited me to primarily melee - I have practically no spells. Also worth noting is the low vitality.\nAs for armour I use the whole Dark Set+5 (40 poise), Grass Cr.Shld.+14, Havels Ring & Darkwoodgraingrgrgr. \nPower within is something I use on occasion, but because of the low vitality I just end up killing myself. \n As I became more and more interested in pvp I noticed though that people that roll with CMW or the likes, will with a similiar weapon to mine, reach almost 1000 AR. Without having to put nearly as much points into strenght.\nSo I often end up against killing machines that have twice as much hp than I do, with a lot faster weapons that deal as much if not more damage than mine, not to mention the array of spells they use.\nI might just do fine against someone, until I miss once - only to be backstabbed as I try to lift an axe the size of a car for what seems like an eternity. Not to mention that it seems to be easy as hell to parry. This has lead me to pretty much only rely on rolling R1's or backstep R1's. The two hand R2 is too useless to even mention, while 1 handing though the second R2 hit is a nice combo but rarely ever connects. If I do manage to connect a straight blow and the opponent is stunned, the second hit - even if it landed straight on the guy, will not for some reason register. Sometimes it does, sometimes it does not - I don't know. In case it does not , they will just hit me back as fast as lightning (yes, lightning) before I have regained and beat me to a pulp in two or three hits. \n So, reddit, I come to you for help: What am I supposed to do? Should I put the last 15 points into Vitality or am I doomed to roll a new character? Change armour, change weapons? I am not particularly fond of the lightning zweis and havels. [summary]: "}

{"input_text": "Once when I was 10 I was dropped off with my dads girlfriends older son (17 or 18 at the time) at Astro Skate for their skateboard night. My dad had parked in a shopping center which was located adjacent to Astro Skate and went in the car with his friend to do whatever they ended up doing. So everything is cool, we skateboard on all the ramps and have a good time. As the place closes up for the night (12:00 a.m. i believe), we leave the building and decide to skate over to my dads car and grab some drinks we had left in it. Keep in mind I just switched from rollerblading to skateboarding, and I was not so good at the whole riding a skateboard thing. \n We make our way back to his car and get into it and grab our drinks. So we're leaning against the car drinking our drinks when a random Camaro comes into the parking lot and circles around about 2 parking lanes away from us. Considering that was a strange thing to do at 12 at night, my friend and I get suspicious just in time for the guy to turn into our lane and head towards us. When is say head towards us, I don't mean make his way at a safe speed limit down the isle to us, no, this guy floored it, and we heard the car speeding up so we got on our boards and bolted back around the building towards the astro skate parking lot. \n I remember pumping for my life and falling off the board probably 2 times, as I look back and see this car hauling ass up to us. We manage to get some distance on him before he made it to us, so we rounded the corner to the back of the building before he was to close, so we hid behind a dumpster.

{"input_text": "I'll probably get downvoted like crazy on this but I don't think you really need to spend much at all.  You probably have everything that you really need.  What you need to do is really learn about what you have. \n Now I may have a bit different attitude to vaping than someone that's only been vaping for 6 months, I've been vaping for over 5 years.  When I started you had to know your equipment just to make it work at all.  And your equipment is only half the battle, you also have to know your juice and how it acts, viscosity, heat resistance, how bad it gunks coils, etc. \n Maintenance is necessary if you are going to get the best out of your gear.  Keeping your batteries clean is very important.  Daily you need to take a q-tip dipped in alcohol (I use PGA) and clean the connector.  At the end of the day, I also wipe down the outside of the batts I've been using for the day.  The finger prints and minor dust on them don't really make that big a difference, but you'll get used to it and will start seeing anything that is different about the batt.  Seeing a minor cut in the wrapper of a 18650 or 14500 while it can be fixed with a piece of clear tape is a lot better than noticing it when it hangs when you try to put in the device.   It also give you a chance to see any bumps and scratches on the outside of your device  early on and can decide if it's a real issue or just cosmetic. \n On you atty/carto/clearo/etc  completely take it apart and clean it at least once a week.  All the parts.  Double check al the gaskets, o-rings, anything that can wear.  A lot of those are replaceable, especially if you have an old one that you can steal part from.  Learn how your device wicks.  With top coil devices at least to me, it seems more important to keep them clean,  a quick rinse and dry burn can gain some time on them.  Bottom coil devices seem a little better about that, but they need a regular cleaning too.  Learn how to properly clean the  coil and wicks - that's what keeps your gear working right and tasting ok. \n If your gear uses replaceable heads, even if you don't intend to learn to rebuild them, take one of the old ones apart carefully.  Lay the pieced out in the order that you removed them and positioned to where they belong.  See how the wick and coil go together, look at where the airflow is and how much clearance there is.  Look at how the bottom pin fits, often a lot of issues can be fixed by pulling that out just a hair.   If they have gaskets or cups or ???  see how they fit against other parts.  A lot of wicking issues can be fixed by adjusting a gasket or flipping it over or being sure it isn't crimped too hard. \n A lot of that sounds like you need to become a mechanic or engineer, and it's not too far off.  You'll be surprised how fast the learning curve is.  Once you know all the parts and how they work together, when you have an issue you'll stand a lot better chance of knowing what is causing the problem.  Once you really learn the first device, learning about the second one is much much faster.  You only have to learn the differences.  It does get easier the longer you do it. \n Sorry for the wall of text. [summary]: "}

{"input_text": "Here's what I have observed about corporate America:  With few exceptions, everyone within the corporation is a decent guy--you, your boss, even his boss.  We all want to get our work done efficiently, and go home, because 'home' is much more important than 'work'.  We want to take pride in what we do.  Even as we become managers, we want good quality of life and a stress-free work environment for the people under us. \n On the other side of the scale from efficient working practices, employee quality of life, etc, is profit.  In smaller companies and smaller businesses, management feeds up to one guy (owner) whose main goal is profit.  But he, like the rest of us, is not an asshole, and is always willing to trade a little of his profit so that he can feel good about doing what is right by his employees and his clients.  There are still assholes that own businesses, but--as with managers--they are the exception and not the rule. \n The problem in corporate America is that the conscientous boss has been replaced with a distant unknown pool of shareholders who couldn't give a fuck about employee quality of life and are only interested in profits.  Now the CEO and, as a result, everyone on down the managerial chain are only interested in employee quality of life to the extent that it affects profits.  They're paying the CEO of my company $20 million dollars a year to maximize profits, not to keep a workforce happy.  If he squeezes out an extra 5% this year, they'll throw in a million dollar handjob.  Do you think he'd trade that money to know that his employees have a better quality of life?--he himself has probably worked 90-hour weeks instead of pursuing any quality of life outside of work--think he'd relate to me being miserable because I never see my family?  No, he'd probably offer me a bonus or higher pay if I do well, because that was what made it all work for him.  All of the upper managers in my company get bonuses if we maximize profits.  If I complain that I don't like 60-hour work-weeks, they'll spend about a week finding a very willing replacement, and have a nice, fat bonus to wipe away any tears caused by sending me to the poor-house.  And if it's not shareholders that are at the top of the pyramid, it's billionaire owner who never sees the majority of his employees, and has the same motives as the good-guy-turned-asshole CEO. \n The same goes for how we, as corporations, treat our clients.  About 98% of us would deal honestly if it were just us, but because we answer to a Profit Monster, we try to extract maximum profit for minimum added value.  When my company negotiates a contract with a government entity, we negotiate what our profit will be up front.  It's typically around 3% of the total contract value, depending on the type of work to be done.  The contract states that we use the other 97% on costs for the project, and give back what is not used, but our profit stays at 3%--this is different from a lump-sum contract, which is the same type of scam, you're just up front about it.  That is essentially OUR JOB, to manage the client's money and project for the owner, for a fee.  But we get greedy.  We have in-house meetings (all of us good, honest guys) and discuss ways to sneak more of the 97% back into our own pocket.  We are no longer doing OUR JOB of managing our clients money well, and in the same process are now stealing some of that money for ourselves.  Some days, it makes me sick.  Some days I think \"I'm sure as hell gonna get a nice bonus this Christmas, because our project is the most profitable in the region.\" \n It would be like me sending a friend to the store to pick up groceries.  \"Hey, go get me some milk and bread from the store.  If you do, you can keep a dollar, just make sure and bring me my change.  Here's a ten.\"  Now if he pays $5, he should keep $1, and give me $4.  But if he keeps $2, and gives me $3, all he has to do is lie about the cost, and he's doubled his profit, and I'm none-the-wiser.  This is what we do in my company.  We lie, we keep more than our stated profit, sometimes twice as much. [summary]: "}

I contributed $5500 and bought some stocks in Amazon, Lockheed and Apple. It's sitting at $6800 today, and I have a little over $2000 available for trading. Should I buy bonds? Vanguard? Ditch it? \n Before all that, I had a 401K at my old job worth roughly $3500. It's been left unchecked for 5 years, and I recently rolled it over to an IRA through USAA. It's currently just...sitting there. No allocations. \n So, [summary]: "}

{"input_text": "Just typing that makes me angry because it sounds weak and and like I defined my identity by my relationship. \n Think about it: this guy was a daily part of your life for 8 years. I don't know how old you are, but still, that's almost a decade. Even if you were 80, that would be 10% of your life. College or high school probably made you who you are too, and that only took 4 years. You spent your nights, mornings, afternoons and evenings with this guy, plus weekends: that's a lot of time. Imagine if you played a sport competitively for 8 years, with 2 hour daily practices and meets every weekend, and then suddenly you tore your ACL and you had to stop.  Obviously, you'd be okay, because an athlete isn't all that you are, but it's still a huge part of your identity. On the one hand, you'd feel like you're no longer part of a community that you'd been in for a long, long time. On the other, a whole chunk of your daily routine would be gone. \n That is to say, of course you feel like a part of your identity is gone with this guy. He had a place in your heart and, most importantly, in your day, for EIGHT FRIKKING YEARS. \n And it's okay that you feel this way. \n The good thing is, now that he's out of your life, you have all that time you used to devote to him to devote to adding a new and exciting thing to your identity. Instead of going to the movies on a Friday night, you can hit the bars and make some new friends. Instead of having lazy Sunday mornings, you could take up 9 am yoga in the park. Or you could take all that time and devote it to sitting down somewhere quiet and thinking hard about your past, your relationship, and how you want to move forward. \n You say that your relationship hasn't been working for a long time, and though you were hurt by this sudden breakup, I'm sure it was hard for him, too, to pull the plug. Sometimes we get very caught up in how a relationship looks on the outside, to other people, and we don't want to ruin \"a good thing\" because other people tell us it's good, even though we, being at the core of it, know that it's actually kind of rotten. I think one of the hardest things about growing up is realizing that something that has always been a dream, something that other people think is so good for you, isn't actually what you really want, and having the strength to put it aside and start over. \n You have all these jumbled feelings of anger and sadness and confusion, but I think it's good that you're able to see through them with optimism and to seek constructive answers and strategies. These next few weeks or months are going to be hard: you're experiencing a huge change in your life. And, although it hurts, the best thing to do is to let yourself experience these feelings to their maximal depth, to let sickness run out before you attempt to heal. It's okay to be sad and angry and bitter for a while. It's okay to feel like an incomplete person. Your boyfriend was a huge part of your life, and it's okay to admit that to yourself and to other people. \n After a while, you will be able to look at this situation objectively and draw conclusions that will be vital to your future relationships. Maybe you and your SO can talk about what went wrong, and continue to be in each other's lives as friends. Maybe not. [summary]: "}
{"input_text": "Ok guys be warned this is LONG post, but I would really like your advice\u2026 I\u2019m not sure what to write.  I need advice and found this subreddit pretty helpful over the past few months.  I recently started a pretty good paying job.  I\u2019ve never really had a bankroll because I didn\u2019t consider poker my profession.  I\u2019m not trying to go pro.  I LOVE playing cards and would classify myself as a recreational player secretly thinking I\u2019m more of a reg than the average. \n When I was in college I would\u2019ve called myself a low-limit live reg. I played 4-5x a week for about 20+ hours a week at the casinos in the surrounding area.  My bankroll was my liferoll\u2026 I was able to support myself through most of my college years.  I didn\u2019t pay for tuition or my housing on my winnings or anything, but things like food, gas, cigarettes (been vaping for 2 months now), entertainment, and things of that nature would come out of my bankroll.  I didn\u2019t really keep track of my winnings and losses.  I just know that I ran one buy-in up to 25 at my max.  It was pretty comfortable and I had a great time.  I learned the game playing live 1/2NLHE.  All my experience was live.  Every now and then I would take shots.  First time I took a shot at 3/5 and tripled up when I flopped the second nut boat and got paid by an over pair and a flush draw.  As a side note, I remembered I was super upset one of my earliest sessions to lose my buy in with KK with no Ace on the board.  I GII on the flop and got tank called by an opened ended straight flush draw.  He got there on the river.  I was so upset at the \u201cgambler.\u201d  Later I found out that he was the favorite to the win the pot when the money went in.  Anyway\u2026 After about 4 years of living on my \u201cprofit\u201d due to a combination of my car breaking down, I had to start paying substantial rent, adult bills, and some run bad\u2026 My bankroll was gone.  This was not the first time my bankroll was gone, I lost it all once GAMBLING at the bigger stakes and taking my debit card with me.  One time in my life I had to ask one of friend to loan me $500 to pay for the remaining portion of my rent because I had played with bill money.  I have never had to do that again.  I felt humbled, embarrassed and like a total degen.  Anyway, this time around I stopped going ALL the time and started adulting.  I found a job in my career and worked.  I went and played live 2-3 times a month. \n I don\u2019t know how it happened but one day I was on the interwebs and found that I could play online in my state, as long as I used certain clients.  I started with BetOnline and after losing a few deposits I chilled out and started reading and researching off the table. 2+2, /r/poker, youtube channels, twitch, reading books, maybe even pirating paid coaching vids\u2026 I started playing on Bovada.  I really like the anonymous feature because I\u2019m unfamiliar with using HUD\u2019s and I feel it takes a bit of Villain\u2019s edge away.  I\u2019ve been playing daily for a couple months, but I am a losing player.  I\u2019ve lost probably close to $400 in the last 2 months\u2026 I love zone poker because I get to see so many hands.  It appealed to me because I could play the top of my range all the time as long as I\u2019m patient.  I\u2019ll double table, single table, play sit n go\u2019s, MTTs, and so on\u2026 no PLO, always been weary of the swings\u2026 I play 2/5, 5/10 and takes shots at 10/25 and 25/50 when I\u2019ve been on a heater.  Here\u2019s the rub.  I think I like the gamble and excitement.  I can\u2019t seem to stay patient playing online like I would at a live poker table.  I\u2019m pretty sure I play too wide preflop.  I\u2019m confident my post flop play is decent.  I am definitely not a NOOB.  I definitely don\u2019t go around bragging that I\u2019m a pro.  I do feel the volume of hands played online as well as the research I\u2019ve done in between my live cash game sessions has actually improved my live game.  Oh and one of my favorite things to do is read hand-analysis posts on this subreddit.  I really like being able to formulate my own decisions and then compare them to the different lines that are suggested.  Anyway, my question is am I an online fish?  What should I do? [summary]: "}
{"input_text": "This happened whilst I was living in Long Beach, CA \n I was coming home from class one day and I walked into my apartment building.  There was a man sitting in the locked lobby and as I walked over to check my mail, he approached me.  He asked if he could use my cellphone to call a friend that was late in picking him up.  I apologized and told him that my cellphone had just died (actually true), but he gave me look that said 'yeah sure, just because I'm black'.  In response to said look, I pulled out my phone to show him the dark screen. \n When I did this, he took it out of my hand and put it in his pocket.  I stood there completely dumb-struck for a few seconds before saying \"Hey...uhhh...can I have my phone back?\"  He responded, \"But it's dead, why do you want it back?\" \n I was dumb-struck again but I asked again.  He told me that \"We should go find a place to bury it together\".  After that, he took a step toward me, placed his hand on my cheek and told me \"I just want to have sex with you right now\" \n I took one  giant  step back and said \"Uhhh no thanks, I just want my phone\" to which he responded \"But, you gave it to me\".  As he had gotten closer, I smelled alcohol on his breath, and I began to think that this wouldn't end well. \n It continued like this for a few minutes, not really knowing what to do except to keep asking for my phone back as the guy stood there.  I didn't want to give some very creepy guy my phone with all my information in it. Strangely, he was defiant but not going anywhere. \n I started to get mad at this and began to scream for help from people living in my building.  This being a semi-crap area, no-one either heard or was paying attention.  Eventually, someone from my building happened to be coming down the stairs to walk his dog.  I had seen this guy a few times before and we had exchanged hellos so I frantically tried to tell him what was happening.  The guy who had my phone simply looked at my neighbor and said \"This guy wants to have sex with me but I don't want to\".  My neighbor looked at the both of us for a few seconds then said he didn't' want to get involved and walked out the door. \n I couldn't believe what was happening!  I started to scream at the guy at the top of my lungs to return my phone.  He started to get a bit agitated.  He told me that if I gave him 20 bucks he would give it back.  I told him to go to hell, so he took my phone from his pocket and said that he was going to break it.  This really pissed me off for some reason (I am not usually a confrontation guy) so I told him that if he broke my phone I would break his face (He was much bigger than me).  I lunged for my phone but he turned away from me.  We started to get into a wrestling match in my lobby and I heard someone yell \"I called the cops!\" from their room.  At this, the guy starts to make for the door and I tried to block it.  We got into another struggle for the door that scraped my side a bit, but he got out. \n He was sort of fast walking down the street, so I chased after him, desperate to try to keep him there for the cops.  I got in front of him, held out my hands and said \"Hey man!  Hey!  Look man, we got off on the wrong foot, lets talk this out\"  He said he just wanted 10 dollars for the phone.  I told him I didn't have it on me but I could get it if he just waited a minute.  At that, he said \"Then I'm breaking your phone\".  As he pulled the phone out of his pocket, I slapped his hands and the phone fell behind him.  He blocked me from picking it up so I grabbed the arm of his sweatshirt and pulled as hard as I could.  It tore his sweatshirt and sent him off-balance.  I did a little dive and grabbed my phone before he could. \n I ran all the way back to the front door of my building, looked back at the dude and screamed \"HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!\" and that was about it.  Cops show up about 45 minutes later, I gave them a description but they didn't seem very interested.  My hands were shaking for about a hour after that. [summary]: "}

For those of you playing at home, that's four and a half years.\nSince the store is located in a college town, it is EXTREMELY busy Thursday, Friday, and Saturday nights. This is in part due to the fact that there is a liquor store next door and students come in to buy cups and chasers before heading to the alcoholic mecca next door. \n One of these weekend nights, I was working in the juice aisle with my coworker, Jon. In some of the aisles of our store, we use the very tippy top shelves for overstock. This means that we place every item that does not fit on the shelf here.\nIn order to prevent stock from falling and killing customers, there is a four inch plastic guard placed at the very edge of the shelf. \n On this particular night, Jon and I were tasked with making sure that the juice stayed stocked up, as this was the mixer/chaser of choice for many a student. \n I was up on a ladder handing down jugs of juice to Jon when two guys about our age stopped to deliberate which type of juice to mix with their liquor. \n We ask if they need help, they decline, and we return to re-juicing the aisle. \n Jon and I are very into the task at hand and stop paying attention to the guys sharing our aisle. I turn my head just in time to see one of the guys, naturally the shorter of the two, reaching up into the overstock shelf for a bottle of juice.\nBefore I can tell him to stop, the bottle gets caught on the plastic guard and plummets to the tile floor, exploding cranberry juice everywhere. \n I stare at the Red Sea slowly creeping down the aisle to where I stood, my face matching the particular shade of crimson. I looked up from the river and stared down the guys. They stared back stupidly. \n \"Does it look like you should be shopping from that shelf?\" I said, struggling to keep my voice at a normal level.\n\"We couldn't find it anywhere else,\" one of the guys responded. \n \"How about here?\" I said sarcastically, gesturing largely to the four or five varieties of Ocean Spray and store brand juice directly beside me. \n The guys skirted the crimson ocean without offering to clean it up, grabbed a bottle of juice that wasn't seven feet off the floor, and proceeded to the checkout area while I mopped at the mess with paper towels.

That combined with my life-long dislike of children (seriously, even as a child I preferred the company of adults because I couldn't deal with the antics of my peers) means I am and always will be decidedly child-free. \n When I was 19, I had to have emergency surgery to remove one of my ovaries (damn thing tried to kill me). My parents were very supportive throughout, but the situation naturally brought the issue of my reproductive capabilities to the forefront (previously, \"female issues\" were only discussed between my mother and me as to not offend the conservative sensibilities of my father). \n After the surgery, he all but cornered the Dr. and demanded to know if I was still able to have children. At the time I was too drugged up to really care, but in hindsight his tone about the whole issue really upset me. He treated my pain and suffering with disregard because he didn't want my \"value\" as a woman to be diminished by being unable to have children. \n Since then, my mother and I have better educated him about just how debilitating my issues can be, which has been an excellent segue into discussion of my child-free future (although unfortunately any discussion has to be framed in the context of my medical situation, as \"because I hate kids\" isn't a legitimate reason to them). We've been discussing \"treatment\" (sterilization) options etc. for the past several years and I really thought we were making progress toward a place of mutual understanding. \n Until today. \n I was chatting with my father earlier this afternoon and he brought up an article he had recently read. It was about a woman who had both her ovaries taken out at a young age and had some of the tissue frozen. She and her partner were able to successfully have a child using her frozen eggs. \n He asked me if I'd known that this was possible. I said that I did, and started to explain that the woman in the article probably used a surrogate and that doing so is very expensive (still dancing around the issue of the fact that I flat out don't want kids). He quickly cut me off with the classic \"well it's a good thing to do in case you change your mind\" and then proceeded to drop this bomb: \n \"I don't work as hard as I do to  not  have a legacy\" \n I was stunned. All I could think to do was remind him that my sibling would likely be giving him grandchildren, which he promptly brushed off with \"that's not the point\". \n My father is a self-made, successful businessman.

{"input_text": "Next semester as in the winter, or the summer? It's a little late to be looking for winter supervisors... anyway, I've found that at the lower undergraduate level, the supervisor's style and the group dynamic is more important than the actual research topic, since it's hard to see the big picture at that stage, and you want to experience lots of different kinds of research. My thoughts on some of the labs: \n\u2013 Fraser Hof usually takes a lot of undergrads. The group has a very positive, fun dynamic, and you get the chance to actually do a lot of useful chemistry (although the training may be a bit narrow in scope). The downside is that you might feel a little lost in the crowd (simply because there are so many people in his group), and Fraser doesn't do as much 1-on-1 mentoring as other supervisors (although you would see a lot of his grad students, and he does project meetings often). Strongly recommended if you're into biochem at all. \n\u2013 Jeremy Wulff is not taking undergrads for the winter, but would probably take you on for the summer. The project would likely be more challenging (CHEM 213 and CHEM 232 strongly recommended), but you would benefit from a lot more 1-on-1 mentorship, both from the grad students (smaller group) and from Dr. Wulff himself. The upside is that you learn a LOT \u2013 the downside is that it's maybe a higher workload than the other labs. \n\u2013 Dave Berg usually takes undergrad students. His research runs the gamut of organic, organometallic, and inorganic, so you'd get a nice range of subject matter. He doesn't have any grad students right now (long story), so all your training would be 1-on-1 with Dr. Berg, and he's a beast in the lab. Probably the best lab training you could get. CHEM 213 would be good to have. Highly recommended \u2013 downside is that there isn't really much of a group, just Dave and any other undergrads he takes on. \n\u2013 Lisa Rosenberg takes undergrads (although usually upper-year students). You'd get good training, the group has a good dynamic, and she does the sort of chemistry that I didn't see much of at the undergraduate level (polymer chemistry, main group stuff). Solid choice. \n\u2013 Scott McIndoe is more of an instruments/measurement guy, and he has a big lab and is very welcoming to undergrads. If you like analytical chem, phys chem, or computer stuff even a little bit, he's your guy. Downside is again, like the Hof group, it can sometimes feel a little overcrowded. \n\u2013 Robin Hicks does physical organic/inorganic kind of stuff. Lots of great senior graduate students for mentoring, interesting projects, and the group gets along pretty well. Good range of techniques, too - it's better to be exposed to a lot of different kinds of chemistry. No real downside that I can think of. \n\u2013 As mentioned below/above, Natia Frank takes undergrads. Interesting research on the physical side of things (photoresponsive materials, magnetic materials). Small group \u2013 see the section on Dave Berg. \nI don't know as much about the dynamics in other labs, so I can't comment. [summary]: "}

Can any one of you tell me what it means. \n Here's google's definition of it:\nThe theory or belief that God does not exist. \n I guess I do fall under the definition of the term but yet it isn't a label I chose to have. It is a label given to me by the religious.

But yet I tell everyone that my belief is not believing god. It makes no sense, furthermore I am embracing a new label that associates me with people that more likely than not embrace their own form of atheism. I didn't abandon religion to jump in with next group of people who think like me because one thing I know about people is they're all fucking crazy. Essentially what i am saying is I hold no believe in god or religion and atheism to me is not a real term and I don't want to associate with atheists (in term) because we all think so differently. Another thing is this label just makes it so much easier for the religious to label and distort our individual images that I am starting to contemplate other ways to say I am an atheist but without the word. I'll start referring to myself as non religious or in absentia faith. \n So how does /r/atheism feel towards the term atheism? Is it really necessary to convey we don't believe in God? [summary]: "}

In 3.02 the top tiers (m2, Pit, Lucas and Diddy) are too good at everything. They simple have no real weaknesses that most characters can exploit. \nBut Fox... His weaknesses are clear as crystal and even quite many Melee low tiers can use them to their advantage, such as DK with his cargo up throw and Roy with his juggles (I still think Fox is a bit too good in NTSC Melee though).  Fox is also very technical and easy to mess up with. Every Melee Fox player plays knowing that when it isn't their day everything can go terribly. This too is one of the things not found in PM's top tiers (perhaps with the exception of Lucas). \nSo in short Fox in Melee has a working risk-reward ratio. That again isn't found in, say, Mewtwo.

She was so enthusiastic about me applying and tried to make it as easy as possible for me to go through the application process. The staff at my school told me I could definitely go for it as well, which made me feel like I had a chance. \n So I wrote my tech test (some code) despite my laptop being incredibly slow and having the worst tonsilitis I'd had in years, and I get an interview with them. I'm over the moon, and I prepare for a full day of assessment (1h of coding with two senior people and logic tests in the morning, and 2 presentations in the afternoon). \n I go in code with the senior people, I'm nervous and need to check a few things but I feel it isn't going too badly. I finish my logic test, and spot the head of recruitment so I go say hi. She comes back to the room with me, sits me down and tells me that everyone loves me but that I'm not quite there yet with my coding, and sends me on my way before I even had a chance to give my presentations. \n I'm really disappointed and it was a little unexpected given how enthusastic everyone had been about me going for that company. I know I have quite a way to go in my coding, which I'm ok with, and which I've been working on since that interview, but the thing is that my school discloses when people get jobs on the school's chat, and today, a 5th person from my cohort got a job at this company. \n Now the people who got the jobs are all really good coders, and they truly deserved the offers, but right now I'm really, really struggling to be kind to myself. Recently I was doing very well to keep my anxiety in check and not compare myself to others, and to take failure as a way to learn and progress, but with each person that gets a job at this company, I get increasingly bitter about my rejection, the people who'll be working there, and the company (to the point that I do not want to work for them anymore and can only think of their bad points to make me feel better about my rejection), and my self-doubt regarding my abilities is getting a lot worse. \n This is made worse as one of the people who got a job and whom I saw as a friend keeps asking me if I actually want to go into coding, keeps telling me it's ok if I don't want to and has even suggested I go into something that is not coding-related. It's making me really doubt myself that I can do it because I feel like if they think I can't, who am I to think I can? \n I kind of feel as though I'll never get a job, that I'm not progressing fast enough and that I'm not a good enough coder full stop.

{"input_text": "You can use an AC switch for DC applications. However, you may need to derate the switch. \n >Mechanical switches do not open instantaneously, Instead, dielectric strength builds as the mechanical contacts of the switch separate. Therefore, there will be a short arc until the dielectric strength is sufficient to hold off the driving voltage. \n >In an AC circuit, this interruption process is assisted by the fact that there is a natural 'current zero' that occurs twice during each cycle. But there are no natural current zeros in a DC circuit. As a result, the actual stress on the contacts will be greater in a DC circuit than in an AC circuit with the same voltage and current. Or saying it differently, if the physical capabilities of the switch are fixed, then it will have to be derated when applied in a DC circuit where the physical stresses associated with interruption will tend to be greater. \n >Firstly, the ratings of switchgear are generally given in RMS values. For example, 10 amps (RMS) AC will produce as much heat (work done) as 10 amps DC. So a switch rated at 10 amps for 230 volts AC will also be ok for 10 amps DC. The only difference will be the voltage. \n >If a switch is used in an AC circuit & that switch is opened under load, an arc will be produced. This arc will quickly self extinguish as the sine wave passes through zero point. This arcing will cause minimal damage to the switch contacts. \n >If a switch is used in a DC circuit & that switch is opened under load, an arc will be produced & will exist for a lot longer than an arc caused by an AC voltage (since the DC voltage is constant - not alternating). This longer arc causes significant damage to the switch contacts. \n >If a switch is used in a DC circuit that has an inductive load, the arcing across the switch contacts will be even more severe due to \"Back EMF\" created by the inductor as it's magnetic field decays. \n >To answer your question, you can use an AC switch in a DC application but the circuit voltage must be significantly smaller than that of the AC voltage. At a rough guess, I would say no greater than about 25% of the AC voltage but it's always best to by an appropriately rated switch. \n >Eg. A switch with an AC rating rating of 100 volts at 10 amps could possibly be used with a 25 volt 10 amp DC circuit. \n >BTW, this only relates to switches & NOT circuit breakers. [summary]: "}

The night comes around, both of us seem giddy to see each other, and the evening is punctuated by a series of heavy makeout sessions - we nearly don't make it out the door to the restaurant. Everything feels like it's going well, get back to my place, lots of kissing and both of us trying as hard as we can to make it last as long as we can. Suddenly and to me out of the blue, his mood changes. His face and tone of voice look and seem angry. He gives me a speech about 'protecting himself' and not being a 'dick to be used' and blows me right off. I'm totally thrown off and don't know what to say but eventually ask where this mood came from, why he's angry, ask why he is saying these things. He shuts me down and leaves. No communication for 2 days after that and then eventually a text acting as if nothing happened, wishing me a good day and asking me when we can see each other again. (note: he was very hard when he blew me off, and we have an established pattern where we tease and work each other up, the rejection did not feel sexual to me, it felt almost as if I was being punished for something, maybe even wanting sex?) \n We see each other 3 days after the date night.

His response? \"I wasn't angry.\" \"You have no reason to be hurt.\" \"The only thing you're hurt about is not getting what you wanted (i.e. dick) that night.\" Just total denial of his own anger, repeated claims that he wasn't angry or upset at all, that he just felt he needed to keep a better hold on himself, emotionally, around me. \n This is one example and I've tried to be brief but this pattern is becoming established and I'm very worried. Something will happen, a fight etc., he'll say something very bitter or cruel (unifying feature? it always feels totally disproportionate to me, something his tone of vioce makes me feel like he hates me) and then - well he used to apologize (but they were always the 'I'm sorry you were upset but you didn't need to be') apologies but now he doesn't mention it again and I have to bring it up if I want to deal with it. At that point he just stonewalls me, completely denies he was angry, tells me point blank I have no reason to be upset with him, if I was upset then it was 100% my fault, I was just whining because I didn't get my way etc. In the example above, yes I was upset, but at that point it had NOTHING to do with sex - I was just fucking flabbergasted at how he acted and why it was so sudden and what the hell had happened. \n I told him this feels 'emotionally dishonest'.

Will this be a piece of cake at level 80? \n Do they intend to change it? \n Is this encouraging botting (similar to the GW1 alcohol title...I think everyone \"botted\" that)? [summary]: "}

I\u2019m sure he would even have a plan in place in case Jon had to be hidden. What if Rhaegar\u2019s plan was to hide Jon as the child of Brandon/Eddard and Ashara and heir to Winterfell? \n Ashara \n The story of Ashara and her interactions with the Starks is well known and common gossip. If Ashara is an agent of Rhaegar, she could have faked a pregnancy or if she is out of the eyes of others in Starfall, they could just say she is pregnant. \n Lyanna \n Of course, Ned blows this all up. The Kings Guard should have been able to stop him but they weren\u2019t. Lyanna might have asked Ned to promise to raise Jon as heir to Winterfell as his own or as Brandon\u2019s. He may have even agreed to this. \n Catelyn \n Ned goes to Starfall and meets Ashara. She outlines the plan to Ned. He can either claim Jon as his own son by Ashara or by Brandon. Either way, Jon would remain hidden, but in a position to possibly claim his rights one day as heir to Rhaegar. However, Ned is an honorable man and he has agreed to marry Catelyn Tully. He won\u2019t betray that by taking Ashara as his wife. \n Robb \n Ned may have broken the promise to raise Jon as heir here, or he may have agreed to say Jon was his or Brandon\u2019s and declare him the Stark heir himself. When Ned gets home with Jon Catelyn is waiting there with Robb though. He can\u2019t dishonor Catelyn by telling her Jon is the Stark heir when he is \u201chis by another woman\u201d and slightly younger than Robb. She would never buy it. Even if Ned legitimized Jon, it would be a slap across the face to jump him over Robb. If Ned had planned to claim him as Brandon\u2019s it might not have been as great an insult, but I\u2019m sure she would still be displeased immediately and at the time, Ned may have thought she would find a way to kill Jon. Eddard didn\u2019t know her character at the time and it would be uncommon for the wife of a great lord to dispose of an heir in favor of her own children. \n Jon Snow \n All Ned can do is claim Jon is his bastard. When he promised Lyanna to make Jon heir to Winterfell, he didn\u2019t know Catelyn was pregnant with Robb. He can still keep Jon hidden and safe though, which is the most important thing. \n Ashara says the fake baby was stillborn and disappears. \n This is why the Winter Kings sit in judgement of him with their direwolves snarling.

{"input_text": "I'm 24, turning 25 in a few days. I'll start from the beginning. \n I was in the middle of a talk with 1 of my friends, and while I was upset she confesses that I have something wrong with me and she knows what it is. I instantly go into a panic, I guess random things that I know for a fact didn't happen or weren't true like \"am I gay?\", \"was I molested?\", \"did I attempt suicide?\" as if I had no memory of anything in my life until she said the secret of my life. \n \"You have aspergers...\" I instantly cry and hug her and thank her for telling me. I knew it all along, I have researched this exact thing before and told myself I was a living version of the wikipedia page but for some reason I never really pursued it. She explains my parents found out when I was 14 when a psychologist believed I had it. My parents stopped bringing me to the psychologist and decided to never tell me, fearing I would use it as an excuse in failings. My sister found out about 5 months ago, after she turned 21 and I went to the bar with her. She told my parents how it was weird I didn't know what to do in a social setting, even when it was all coworkers we both knew. My parents confessed to her what it was, she proceeded to blab to a few people and I eventually find out from a friend. I go to sleep thinking of all the times I know it interfered with my life. I thought about being mad at my sister for blabbing a bit, but I'm just happy I know I don't care how it happened. \n At work I started thinking about what I was doing, the repetitiveness and how much I enjoyed knowing what I have to do for the next 8 hours with nothing interfering.  Every decision I've made has been based on how to avoid human contact to give me the most time to do the thing I'm doing. I feel safe in this spot, but only this spot. Put me in a different part of the building and it'll take me awhile to adjust. \n Aspergers is all I've been thinking about, it's literally consumed my life. I'm at work thinking of how my parents knew I had social problems yet allowed me to get pushed around in sports and be beyond miserable in high school. Why did they put me in hockey? A team sport where I'm at an extreme disadvantage physically. (I was probably 130 pounds back then) and then I start realizing I failed them in basically every test that was given to me. Depression consumes me, I have to leave work early. I'm a failure to them, their first son is a failure. I knew I was going to get over being sad though, I always just revert to happiness about most subjects eventually. \n And then I'm not sad anymore, just like that. I may have aspergers, I may not. I probably do I've shown all the signs my whole life, so I'll just pay attention and impress myself by sometimes reacting differently than I would before I knew I had aspergers. \n Yea I just typed a huge ass wall of incoherent text almost no one will read but I don't care. I'd usually delete something I'm not 100% confident in, but I'm choosing to just relax. \n Edit: This was my thought process from the time I learned of my aspers till now, in great detail lol...

{"input_text": "u/Bonbonbonbons made a really good point about the basic essentials being boring for beginners. You need to stoke the fire in them that makes them say \"I want to be able to play that\", which will encourage them to want to pratice by themself. \n Think about in terms of grades. In grade one you learn single and double strokes, the basic rock beat, and how to count crotchets/quarter notes/rests. Think about what song this can be applied to. For me, ACDC - Highway to Hell is an excellent starting point for beginners, it incorporates all of those rudiments with a couple of tricky bits that will segue nicely into grade 2. \n In the first lesson (hour long, or there-abouts) I'd spend the first 20 mins going over the parts of the kit, given that you're teaching on a kit, and how to approach the drums; stick grip, how to strike different pieces (cymbals, hi-hats, snare, kick drum), ergonomics etc. This is something that veteran drummers will still make adjustments to, so don't worry about it coming right away. Take your time getting the grip right especially. \n In the second third of the lesson, establish that you're going to progressively go over the 40 essential rudiments, starting with singles and doubles (paradiddles too if they're super keen), as this is the foundation to nearly all other rudiments. You can work on this in future lessons with exercise sheets. For example, a single stroke roll with a rest one the 1, next resting on the 2 etc. And make sure he's counting out loud, it's easier to learn sooner than later. \n Then in the last 20 mins/half an hour or whatever you can go over a song that you've decided he'd like to play. Make it sound like a end of grade exam which he can work toward before progressing onto the next challenge. Find the sheet music and spend a good amount of time talking through the score, play the song and have him follow where he is on the sheet. He should be able to identify where the repeats are, what DS al Coda is all about, and follow it with his own finger all the way through. Once he can identify which parts of the song he's struggling with, you can spend some time going over individual parts with him, then piece it all together. \n Send him away with the sheet music and exercise sheet, and tell him to tick off all the exercises that he feels comfortable enough to play infront of you next week. Tell him 5 minutes a day (the length of an ad break in a tv show, or the time inbetween a few games of COD) with sticks in hand is a helluva lot better than 0 minutes. He doesn't even need to be at his practice pad to work on the exercies sheet, knee drumming ftw. \n My final piece of advice would be not to say things like \"In a couple of years time, you'll be jazzing hard/thrashing hard/funking hard\". Kids want real results infront of them instantly. If they see it as the long sprawling process that it actually is, you could extinguish that desire that made them want to jump on the kit in the first place. \n What's r/Drumming's opinion on teaching? What are your techniques for teaching beginners? I've thought for some time now that the rate at which rudiments are taught is actually quite slow. Would it be too much to expect a grade one student to have control of singles, doubles, paradiddles and flams? [summary]: "}
{"input_text": "Right now the best measure of possession would be Corsi or Fenwick (total shots directed towards opposing net, fenwick takes out blocked shots) \n Basically it would be hard to look at what comes from Gardiners turnovers, as it would be hard to see what comes from dumping the puck around the boards (seriously, TO THE LINE AND NOT OUT, is something Leafs fans hear ALOT) and giving up possession that way... but you can see here  that Gardiner has a very high CorsiRel (30.2), that tells you that more shots are being taken on the opposing net when Gardiner is on the ice compared to when he is off the ice. \n Looking into it further you could deduce the fact that even though Gardiner is turning it over (again I say his turn overs are more obvious to the naked eye as he likes to skate with the puck instead of just dumping it) his turnovers aren't resulting in shots on Reimer or Scrivens, and if they are resulting in shots he is still doing enough to get the puck into the offensive zone and onto the opposing goal more often then it happens to him. \n CorsiRel amongst all Leafs skaters: \n edit:  The other thing to note with this argument is \"Gardiner turns it over in the defensive zone so much\" is a biased opinion based on what people WANT to see.

Who has had the most success as protoss? MC, and how does he play? He plays with a ton of \"rip your head off\" timing attacks, which in my opinion is the \"correct\" way to play protoss if you want to win more often. There haven't been any amazingly dominate passive macro protoss players. Rain and Parting are cool but they are not a protoss innovation/flash/life. \n This is why people often complain about protoss and even call it imbalanced. As someone who can play all three races at masters level: I don't think protoss is  overpowered  or  underpowered   - protoss wins it's fair share of games. What it doesn't do though is let better players win consistently enough (and bad players lose enough). There's no Innovation of Protoss because even if Innovation played protoss he wouldn't be as consistent as he can be with Terran. Terran is  very  hard to play at the level he plays it, but since he can it allows him to dominate lesser players very consistently. Protoss doesn't have that because it's gimmicky, all-in, and luck plays too big of a role. \n Because of this there are protoss players who are rated much higher on ladder than they should be: they have one or too all-ins which work often enough. But the  best  protoss are being held back by those same mechanics. I'm good at terran and zerg so I don't know why I keep playing protoss.

I think I got the virus from kissing a girl at a skating rink when I was like 11. Anyway, I figured out how to stop it shortly after you realize it's there. \n Here's my way: \n As soon as you know you have a cold sore-- like you feel a tingling sensation on your lip or you wake up with it, do this. \n Step one: get an ice cube from the fridge and apply it to the area for about 30 seconds. This step should be repeated as often as you have time. \n Step two: never let your lips get dry. Always apply a lip treatment, some chapstick with vitamins and what not, that you have found to be good from previous use. I got one called Aveeno and it works fine. \n Step three: pick up a bottle of the amino acid pills called Lysine. Check out this article that talks about how cold sores, or the virus in your body, feeds off or Arginine in order to grow. Lysine sort of blocks the growth of the cold sore. Take 5 of those pills (they are harmless to take) about 3 times a day, and before bed. \n Step four: don't eat greasy food or foods high in Arginine. You don't have to modify your diet for a long time, because after taking Lysine and constantly putting ice on the sore, it will be gone in about two days, and it won't move past the stage before it turns into a sore (when it's red). I guess I should call this cold sore preemptive action. \n I know this is sort of a weird topic, but I also know many people get cold sores and really hate them. Anyway, follow the steps I listed, especially applying ice very frequently, and watch your diet. Fasting is a good thing as well-- not eating as much. Your body can fight off a sickness much easier this way. \n Abreva, \"the only non-prescription cold sore medication approved by the FDA to shorten healing time and the duration of cold sore symptoms,\" does almost nothing. Don't waste the 16 dollars or whatever it costs to buy it. [summary]: "}

{"input_text": "The main thing that I see it the fact that over all a Vanguard unit will always cost more points than the Assault squad. Base cost for five Vanguards is 25pts/model with the addition of up to five models at 20/model making a total of 225pts for a full not-upgraded Vanguard squad; while the Assault squad is 20pts/model for a five models with up to five additional models at 18pts/model making a full not-upgraded squad worth 190pts. \n Vanguard vets are nice with the higher LD and higher number of attacks than your standard Assault squad, except the points will always be the biggest factor. \n Earlier I said a full squad of Vanguard Vets costs 225pts without upgrades. This means in order to use their cool \"Heroic Intervention\" ability means you have to buy the jump packs in addition to the squad and other upgrades you want to kit them out with. So a full squad of Vanguard Vets with jump packs will cost 325pts with no other upgrades. A full unit of Assault Marines only costs 190pts WITH jump packs. \n Yes a Vanguard squad can be deadly if used correctly, however the points used to make them deadly is really just horrible to make use of one ability that MIGHT work if you have really good dice rolls that can get the Vanguard Squad within 6 inches of that really juicy HQ/Heavy Support or what have you.

She started gaining the public's attention when she was Paris Hilton's best friend, but at that point she was basically an E-list celebrity. She also had a tiny bit of fame because her father was OJ Simpson's lawyer, but that doesn't really contribute. Then in February 2007, her (private) sex tape was released (without her consent). U know who else had their nudes leaked in 2007? Vanessa Hudgens. And honestly, who's more relevant right now, or anytime in the past 5 years? I'm not saying the sex tape isn't why Kim is famous, because she definitely wouldn't be where she is today without it, but there's so many other good things Kim Kardashian does to maintain fame that people could talk about, but  they just want to say how she was popularized because of a sex tape. Paris Hilton and Tila Tequila are both famous because of sex tapes too, and I've honestly never seen people criticizing them for it. Kim Kardashian donates 10% of her money to 17 charities and 24 causes, but people never want to talk about that. She was exploited by Ray J, a man she trusted, and instead of having one big moment of shame, she took the fame she received and used it to her advantage.

{"input_text": "One summer, in between my junior and senior year of high school, a buddy of mine, who had just graduated and was about to start college, asked me for some help. He was moving out on his own and his grandparents were giving him some furniture for his new place. We hop in his truck and take off for his grandparents house which is about an hour down the highway. It's important to know that it's summer, and his truck doesn't have A/C, so we are cruising with the windows down. \n So as we are driving we see this guy on a bicycle riding down the shoulder of the highway. Being the young punk high schooler that I was I had the brilliant idea to \"scare this motherfucker.\" Another important detail to this story is that for some reason my friend has a pare (the fruit) sitting in the cup holder.  I hadn't thought much of it but now I see opportunity. Now, I'm not so sadistic that I leaned out the window and took aim at the bicyclists. I just, using my left hand, throw the pare across my body without my elbow ever leaving the arm rest. \n In my mind I would miss this guy just barely and scare him. Also in my mind if I did hit it wouldn't hurt that bad because I didn't throw it that hard. In reality I hit him in the back/side of the head with a pare traveling at around 80mph and this motherfucker cartwheeled off his bicycle. It was at this point my friend didn't pull over and we never checked on him to see if he was alright. We were afraid of the consequences and the rest of the day was just my friend and I yelling at one another about how stupid I was. \n I watched the news diligently for the next month waiting for them to say something like police are investigating the death of man on highway; cause of death, blunt force by fruit. Good news is nothing was ever reported so I think he lived. Or he was homeless and didn't have any family that cared. I guess he could still be rotting in ditch after all these years but I like to think he lived. \n I'm not sure how accidental this is because I did mean to throw the pare but I never meant to hit him.

{"input_text": "Yes, but that still doesn't proove evolution of the species. Flu viruses don't \"evolve\" into different species, they adapted, they saw that their patterns (per say) weren't working against body cells, so they changed so that it would. The flu virus is still a flu virus. I'm also sure that ancient species didn't decide that their body was obsolete, and decided to change species over the course of a year, so don't say that the flu virus prooves anything. It might just be me, but the fact that a species of moth changed color during the Industrial Revolution is more of a mutation due to sudden toxic chemical release, than a species suddenly evolving into a new species that is a different color. Micro-evolution, the small change within a species that isn't significant enough to make it an entirely different species, is possible. Like a person going to a hot place and becoming tan, and over time his children look a little more African, is an example of that, but an African or an Asian is still a human, and they can still successfully reproduce with each other, and aren't going to change into another species because of it. \n Look, the fact is that neither of us are getting anywhere. Monkeys may have similiar chromosomes to us, but that doesn't proove anything other than that monkeys have similiar chromosomes to us. If you look at a monkey's chromosomes, they do not say, \"I am similiar to a human's, so evolution is true.\" The chromosomes don't say anything, they just carry the traits that that monkey is going to have. That doesn't proove evolution, it just makes it more plausible. All of what you said doesn't proove evolution, it just makes it seem more plausible. If I told you that scuba divers have found numerous ancient chariot spokes, and decayed horse hooves and such all along, in a line under the Red Sea, that wouldn't proove Christianity, that just makes it seem more plausible. To me that may cause me to think that that makes what I believe true, but to you it means nothing, and vice versa. We can throw \"evidence\" at each other all day, but it will never proove anything, and at the end of the day we will still believe what we believed in the first place, maybe even stronger. You see something in science, and because you believe in evolution you say that that piece of science is evidence for evolution, but I don't believe that, so I don't see it that way. Does that mean I'm wrong because you believe it? No. Does it make you wrong because I don't believe it? No. Neither of us are right. That piece of science doesn't say anything about what we believe, we just interpret it that way. Until either of us presents some actual, hardcore evidence, that without a doubt prooves either of our beliefs, we are going to believe what we want to believe. \n Now don't start giving me crap for saying this, and downvote me, and bombard me with reasons why whatever I said is wrong, and you are obviously right.

If you can trace it back to one author or a small group of authors in a relatively tight time frame than you can essentially assume that it was made up as any religion with any kind of powerful deity would probably not be so interested in such a tiny group at such a specific time. (As a side note, with those kind of religions, generally I tend to see the people who wrote the rules profiting a lot which once again sets off my BS alarm). Currently the religion I have found to be the most free of this activity is Christianity but even then I'd have to point to most of modern Christianity being essentially a derivative of Catholicism; Catholicism is one of the easiest examples of the use of religion as a tool instead of as actual religion. The Catholic Church as it was in the Dark Ages essentially used religion to dominate the masses while individuals profited; they did this through writing additional works to the holy book and by keeping the actual holy book from the masses as it was written in Latin. The original holy book on the other hand has ~40 different authors over roughly 2,000 years and the entire book reads as if it had one even through all the translation problems you run into when a book is written in 3+ languages. None of this is for sure obviously which makes sense as faith is usually a large part of any religion so assuming one is correct, that God probably didn't leave any obvious clues, just small ones that are enough to point in the right direction.

If this incident makes a person not want to watch football anymore, then that person has fundamentally misunderstood the game, and requires education that the American media are clearly not equipped to provide. \n My point about Cesc and Wilshere (and Messi since you mentioned him) was that everybody manipulates the ref - whether it is justified is entirely subjective and cannot be described in 25 seconds of footage. Those guys are kicked to shit in incidents far too small for officials to recognise. They achieve justice in their contest with antagonistic players by embellishing in incidents that are spotted. Many players, like Suarez, go into a game looking to con a ref through exaggeration. This is the subjective ambiguity of the game, and the reason that cards don't get rescinded and players don't get banned for diving when there's contact. \n The American/internet media, however, didn't present the ambiguity in the incident, and thus failed football fans everywhere as debate and good sense was drowned out by righteous US fans. They brushed over the tredding, and missed an opportunity to educate their more casual fans on: how painful studding is; the possibility of a subtle but deliberate move by Besler; the harsh nature of individual competition between soccer players, particularly strikers vs centrebacks. They didn't do this because they either a) themselves don't know how painful it is, and/or b) just wanted to engage in some yellow journalism and manipulate USA fans. \n That's why I don't want to hear about this incident, as if it's important in the slightest, or whether it describes Campbell's sense of fair play, until he develops for form it.

{"input_text": "I think got a pretty solid theory on why imgur went with h.264(gifv) vs VP8(webm). And it's pretty disappointing and not even really imgur's fault. \n Apple does not support VP8. iPhones do not have hardware VP8 decoding. I think it is safe to assume that a large chunk of imgur's traffic comes from iOS devices/safari (although you can add VP8 support to safari with an add on). Imgur could do what gfycat does and host both a webm and .mp4 formatted file and display them based on user compatibility. But then they have to host two files rather than one. \n So what? h.264 is supported by everyone and it's quality in some cases is slightly better than VP8. Well the problem is that h.264 is a closed source format that draws on a number of software patents (read: royalties). VP8/9 is open source,carries no patents, and is royalty-free. The holders of those h.264 patents get a payout for every h.264 license sold. Apple of course owns some of those h.264 patents, and hence profits on those h.264 licenses. Obviously Apple would like to see h.264/HVEC come out as the victor of the battle for the future internet video standard. Apple has a lot of weight to throw around too (see the imgur case I made above). This puts everyone in a pretty bad spot, because I think most can agree that it would be best if a free open source format became the new standard. \n I should note that microsoft, who also holds h.264 patents, doesn't support vp8 either. I doubt IE is too popular on imgur (but like safari, support can be added) and I know that windows phone (despite having hardware VP8 decoding, it's disabled) hardly has a presence at all.

{"input_text": "I've been with a wonderful, smart, funny, beautiful girl for the better part of a year now. We haven't had sex, (oral either,) but we're intimate. \n She knows that she's not my first, and I know that I AM her first. \n Here's the deal, every time we start fooling around, she's content to help me finish, but will stop me before she does. If I'm fingering her, she'll stop me after a little bit, even if she says it's feeling good. What's up with this? This sounds bad, but at first I was cool with it, because I was still getting some, but now I care about her so much that I wish I could understand why she does this. I really would rather give her an orgasm than receive a BJ. (as crazy as that sounds.) \n Could anyone give me an explanation or advice with this situation? \n EDIT: We're both 19, I'm almost 20. \n EDIT2:  MORE INFO : She tells me what feels good, and I know that clit stimulation feels better for her than any actual vaginal fingering I've done. She also is quick to tell me what DOESN'T feel good. The first time I fingered her was really bad. She had never had anything in her vagina other than a tampon. She bled a little, and I couldn't get more than one finger in. I stupidly tried to push two, and she actually yelped out in pain. I didn't try anymore after that, and although she told me it was alright, and that she was ok, I still felt bad. We've gotten past that though, and I've fingered her many times since then. The main problem here is that she keeps stopping me. I desperately want to help her reach orgasm. \n Even though I had sex a few times before our relationship started, I'm ashamed to say I had never really LOOKED at female parts before. I had a general idea of where everything was, but I never really LOOKED before. She had never seen a penis before, so she understood my desire to really have a look around down there and she obliged. \n EDIT3: MORE INFO: she was incredibly shy when we first started dating, not shy in a friendly way, (she's very outgoing) but more in way where I could tell she was not used to me or she was uncomfortable with me. We didn't even kiss until over 3 months into our relationship. She had never even kissed anyone before me. She about jumped out of her skin the first time I put my arm around her at the movies.\n She's incredibly beautiful, and I make sure I tell her that a lot. That being said, she's still very shy about her body. Once during a movie marathon, I asked if she'd watch with me while she was naked. I stayed clothed, but asked if she'd take off her clothes. This might sound weird, but my thinking was hoping that she'd be more comfortable around me and more comfortable with herself naked. She did it. So that was a step in the right direction... I hope. \n EDIT4: We're actually remarkably open about masturbation. She's only done it a handful of times, and she knows that I do it. (a lot.) haha... \n Here's another weird thing... She can always, ALWAYS tell when I've masturbated that day or not. It actually kind of freaks me out. I'll be watching TV and talking, or we'll be cuddling, or I'll be on the computer, (it doesn't matter where I am or what I'm doing) she'll just come out and say \"you masturbated today didn't you?\" She's always right. I don't do it every day, and actually for a week I didn't do it. I asked her every day whether she could tell if I had or not, and she answered correctly every time. On the last day I blew a giant load, and when she came over later she told me she could tell that I had.

Even though we\u2019ve been getting more ad/attack speed items for the past years, itemization choices still feel very dull and I believe this is due to the Infinity Edge + phantom dancer/statick shiv combo since when bought together they become extremely cost efficient since it doubles your ad for ~55% of your autoattacks without counting Trinity and Ghostblade and this overclasses any other combination AD/AS. \n I\u2019ve often wanted to pick up other ~50% attack speed items or even the new Essence Reaver but I usually get flamed a lot and indeed your damage suffers greatly because all the cool effects all the other items have just can\u2019t make up for all the damage you\u2019re missing out by not going IE + PD/SS. \n Yes there are more openings now like Triforce and BoTRK but the final builds will end up with these crit items most of the time, leaving no room for all the other marksmen items in the repertoire.

{"input_text": "So we've been married for 1 year and 3 months but have lived together for 5 years prior to making it official.  both of us are 30. Ever since I've known my wife, I've always felt that she has had anger issues...or is highly sensitive or highly irritable to minor things that i do. \n Just one example of the hundreds, a few weeks ago, I had her meet me at a restaurant and I text her directions because she was lazy to use the navigation system in her car...it was not an unfamiliar area and we've been there many times but I drove. this would be her first time driving there. I told her to go west instead of east and she was late...I said it was an accident and she blew up on me, used curse words, said FuckYou..all that.. \n She says very mean and hurtful condescending things to me...I must say that I'm guilty of it too but only recently because I finally could only take so much...during our first 4 years being together, I was the one who always stepped down...whenever she got mad, I said Sorry, even though deep down inside I felt that it wasn't my fault. I swallowed it and took it in the nuts..sucked it up and moved on...there were several instances in which she threatened to leave me and me being the idiot kept trying to hold on to her...I never let her walk out that door...now I'm not sure if it was because I loved her or because I was scared to be alone. \n Basically, ever since the beginning, and to avoid any kind of shit face attitudes, I've taken crap from her...here was the game changer, basically a month after we official got married, she fought with my Mom.. Me Being very close to my mom, I took great offense and i blew up on her....I talked back to her, I argued, and I didn't apologize like how I always did...I told my wife she was wrong for what she did to my mom....its like, u can say or do whatever u want to me, but don't attack my family...Well, she took it as I was defending my family and I was NOT on her side...so basically she viewed me as being not supportive as a husband. \n The first year of our marriage was very rocky. I stopped being Mr. nice guy and I had much resentment towards her for not getting along with my family and not wanting to come to our family gatherings...just 4 months ago, she took the initiative to apologize to my mom and she slowly came around again...she said she did this only because she knew it would make me happy.  IN RETURN, HOWEVER, i promised to let things go between us and not get mad at her or talk back etc etc. \n Well, i let the resentment go and she hasn't. she uses every and any opportunity to hit me with something hurtful. She says very demeaning things to me and treats me like i was a dog. She says it was hard and against her principles to apologize to my mom and because she did that, i have to suffer now.  Tit for tac, basically making me feel the pain that she feels but 10 times worse. Last night she told me if I fire ONE bullet at her, she would fire TEN back. \n She clowns on my job, my family, calls me loser, says shed rather be with anyone other than me...When i get mad, and what sane person wouldn't? she tells me to just ignore it and let it go...because at the end of the day, she says her intention is not bad because she is still here. \n Even recently when she wanted to leave, it was me who held her back, promising I would do \"anything\" to keep her.. Well she took that literally and is making me go thru hell.  she says there is no compromise between us. She told me its her way or the highway and I have to STFU and take it if I still want her.. Her reasoning is that she wanted to leave a long time ago but because I wanted her to stay, I now have to work for it because she is done. \n She says we tried doing it my way before (compromising, that is) but it never worked. So now it has to be her way only and her way is making me promise A, B, C...If I do D, then the promise is broken, and she leaves...which is what happened 2 nights ago when I got irritated by a mean comment she said to me. I answered back, and since that was not ABC, then she threatened to leave again.  Me, of course, promised to change again. \n Whenever I want to have a discussion with her, I can never get a word in whatsoever. If I do, she will turn it around and bounce it right back. its like watching a tennis match, back and forth...all day long...we once argued from morning till night...She has a way of taking whatever I say and making me see why it was my fault and why I was wrong. \n I asked her why she is so angry. She says that she was never this way before she met me. She says me and my family are the root cause of all her anger issues. and BECAUSE i am the problem, I OWE her for putting up with it.. \n (a little background, I come from a family of doctors and highly successful entrepreneurs. I have a business degree and own my own business. my wife has only had high school education. her immediate family is on welfare, the ones that aren't on welfare have average jobs that pay the bills)  < I'm thinking she has insecurity issues but will never admit it.  It is clear that me and my family are far more successful than hers, but she tells me all the time that she looks down on my family.  that hurts me because my family worked hard to get to where they are today.. they didn't just win the lotto. \n I worked for all our relationship. paid all the bills and supported her and our 3 dogs, no kids, while she sat at home sleeping in, watching TV, and playing face book.  I clean after the dogs, do the housework, and laundry. I used to cook but I stopped now and just buy her food. \n So in a nutshell, she has made me make promises to her that she knows I'm going to fail at because its so clear cut and dry. I feel like she's just making it easier for her to leave. But every time I keep apologizing and saying that I was wrong and its all my fault.  She blames me for her misery and her situation and her loss of time. [summary]: "}

Tropic yes - but still felt very land heavy.  My map would be very very water heavy.  Anyone who played the original Far Cry will know that the best damn level in the game (maybe ever made) was \"Boat\".  You had to navigate to 3 islands and take out communications satellites on each (in any order) and then you went to a boat at the end which had a badass helicopter fight. \n My map would have water be a primary means of travel - speed boats, jet skis, fishing boats, patrol boats, etc.  There would be a vast network of rivers and inlets to allow the player to move around the islands by water. \n Setting:\nLike FC3 and 4 the setting would have ties to real world situations.  In this case - East African Piracy.  I think we all know the situation with the Somalian priates and the film Capt. Phillips.  These islands would be a haven for modern day pirates who prey on private and commercial ships.  Our primary enemy would be the pirates who now control these islands. \n The island would be split into 4 primary locations: \n 1: Ruined temples - These could be Mayan or Indonesian inspired, but the idea is to have a large set of above and below ground temples dotting the southern islands. \n 2: Resort area - A nearly completed but abandoned and crumbling set of hotels, pools, beachfronts, stores, etc.  Like Hashima Island (from Skyfall) this resort would be the ultimate derelict playground. \n 3: Semi-inhabited residential district - Built to house the workers for the resort but is now fallen into disrepair and is inhabited by the islands non-pirate civilians.  Another mix of modern economy housing mixed with dereliction. \n 4: The Pirate Atoll - A large volcanic Atoll that houses multiple pirate fortresses (maybe from WW2?) - think huge stone fortresses mostly built into the mountain.  These fortresses are home to the vast pirate army that controls the island. \n \n Ship Graveyard - Since these pirates prey on commercial and private vessels they would no doubt have a collection of derelict vessels being scrapped in the bay.  The bay itself would be contaminated by oil and gasoline.  There would be ships capsized and rusting all over the bay in various states of floating. [summary]: "}

{"input_text": "So, first off, I've learned over the years that I apparently experience and express love primarily through physical intimacy.  Sex does not have to be a part of it but is of course the most expressive of this. \n Started a relationship with a girl a couple months ago.  First warning sign for me was her almost ending the relationship because I wasn't her type after the third date.  I called her on that bullshit when she tried to pass it off as something else and the fact that I caller her on it somehow made her interested enough to date further, things proceeded fine. \n Second warning sign was a few days later when we had sex for the first time, no orgasm, she tells me she almost never has them and this is normal, which scared the shit out of me because I can't have fun sexually if I don't think the other person is.  BUT, I took it as a challenge and a couple hours later we had sex again and she did and was delightfully surprised. \n Over the two months this has gone from a few orgasms to a ridiculous amount every time, with her far beyond satisfied, wiped out etc.  But very one sided.  She's pointed out from a couple weeks in that she thought she was \"spoiled\" and that I should be more selfish in sex.  I wasn't because I don't like to take.  Give and receive is how I see the world. \n I think that was a mistake, because she didn't so much as make an attempt.  Complete, selfish dead fish in the bedroom. \n Ok, so that's just sex right?  How about the intimacy?  Well as it turns out I pretty much don't exist in the room at all unless she's at least somewhat in the mood.  We've talked and apparently she has a long history of calling up guys up guys for booty calls and kicking them to the curb.  She says this is because she doesn't understand intimacy.  Maybe, but I'd throw in some basic selfishness in there too to be honest, she's very thoughtful in most other ways. \n So, enough was enough but I didn't want to be a jerk or fight.  So I talked to her, at length, for hours about our relationship, about what her needs were and how she felt love, and of course how I did.  Kind of a \"maybe she just doesn't understand\".  Couple days, no sexuation initiation, interest, or even positive responses.  Little to no intimacy and always completely on her terms. \n So we talk again, because now I feel a bit neglected.  I make that clear.  We talk again. \n The next night she shuts me down by swatting me away.  At the time, I just wasn't happy with that.  But I was quiet and tried to move along.  Turns out she had a bladder infection.  But she didn't tell me.  When we talked afterwards she said she didn't tell me because it literally just did not cross her mind that what I thought about the situation (did I do something wrong?  Are you just not in the mood) didn't even cross her mind.  If this had happened before those two conversations whatever, but now I'm pissed because basic communication isn't doing it.  She does not care about my needs is how I see it now. \n Last night, she insists on talking and it becomes a fight.  First time I've yelled at a person in years and I feel like shit the whole time.  I get mean, tell her she's a dead fish in bed and doing NOTHING in terms of intimacy independent of sex.  I ask why because we talked about it twice.  Reasons range from I didn't understand to I didn't remember to I don't have a sex drive as strong as you as wouldn't normally want sex more than once in a while (that one was important) to she's just new to real relationships to all kinds of shit that even starts to contradict itself (standard fight format....god I hate fights). \n End of it she says she feels great and finally understands and knows what she needs to do. \n I feel like COMPLETE shit.  I hate that she knew what I needed and didn't care.  I hate a fuck load of a lot more that after hours of clear communication that she claims to not understand until we fight and thinks that's better.  I don't.  Fighting is bullshit.\nShe made a clumsy sexual advance in the bed like 30 fucking minutes later...  Keep in mind that night she ignored me.  Like I wasn't fucking there.  I assumed because we had talked the night before and weren't super happy, or because she had a bladder infection.  Whatever, you're not in the mood, maybe pay attention to me for all of 5 minutes anyway.  And now all of a sudden after a fight, the bladder infection is magically just fine and she's suddenly in the mood.  Bullsiht, or fucked up shit, or shit I don't understand. \n Either way.  So much was said last night I don't know how it can taken back.\nI'm disgusted and completely not attracted to her right now.\nI don't believe it will change.  The fact that she said she would prefer not to have sex more often than not, doesn't need it much, and just assumed I didn't either even after I explained that wasn't the case tells me her sexual needs are different than mine, and will probably never change (right?).  Mine did over the last few years but that was something I did for myself, not someone else (I was a selfish dead fish years ago too).\nI just...I think it's time to accept it won't work and move on.  Why wait for weeks or months while she makes sexual advances she doesn't want to make and isn't interested in just because she thinks that'll please me?  Nothing could be a bigger turn off or make me feel less valued. \n Help?  Is there hope? (I do love her...I believe she loves me...that's why I'm so ranty and angry...I'm normally very very chill...I wish it could work, she's SO AMAZING in every other way, she just doesn't seem to care about whether or not I feel loved) \n Doesn't matter much but apparently she feels very loved because I do \"thoughtful\"(basic really) things for her, and I've done that from the start deliberately because I knew it would communicate my love...I want the same in return.

{"input_text": "TW:Self Harm, suicide, emotional abuse, physical abuse] \n This is the first time I'm posting here, sorry if my English is weird, it's not my first language, and sorry if I did the tagging all wrong, I tried my best! \n I am afraid this might turn out to be a wall of text, so I'm sorry if this is too long. \n A little background: I am almost 29 (f) and I have 2 slightly younger siblings. My Ndad and I are NC. He used to live with us until I was about 14-15 and he was (or is still, idk) an alcoholic. \nWhen I was 8 my parents, siblings and I moved in with my Ngrandma after my grandpa died of cancer, because my grandpa on his deathbed made my mom  promise to move in with Ngma. \n My Ndad used to beat me and my brother when we lived in our own house, so after we moved in with Ngma the two Ns got into fights about bringing up children. She would yell at him for hitting us, he would go to his room in the basement and drink, then she would turn around and tell me how disgusting, stupid and fat I was and that I should be grateful she takes care of me. \n Anyway this went on for a few years, her always letting me know that I am lazy and stupid because I couldn't cook/clean properly/etc but her also not teaching me because \"you can't do this anyway\". Not sure if this is a normal thing with Ns but that's what I experienced. \nMy mother was for sure an enabler, not entirely believing me when I said Ndad was hitting me and Ngma wasn't letting me do anything, but my mom also was working from morning until almost night and then was too exhausted to properly care. And she was also being verbally abused by Ndad and Ngma. There were other situations that were a lot more traumatizing but I don't think I want to disclose those at this point. \n So this was going on until my parents divorced (I was so happy that I cried. I was so relieved) and after that I \"only\" had to deal with Ngma. She got worse the older I got, telling other family members that I was a \"slut\" and had a \"different boy in my room every night\"... which isn't true. I had my first boyfriend when I turned 16 and we were a couple for 3 years. But yeah, I guess that's just regular N behaviour probably. \n When I was 18 I started going to therapy for self-harm and past sexual abuse. I was diagnosed with BPD and at the time I felt like a monster. So many people online were going on about how terrible people with BPD are and that they are manipulators and bad people and it just freaked me out and it was hard. So I tried not to tell anyone about my diagnosis, and I was still living in that house with Ngma and I knew she would spin this somehow to make me look bad. She was already making fun of my scars etc. whenever she noticed them. \nWhen I was 20 I moved into a roommate apartment situation in a town 2 hours away with 2 girls who only spoke French (I am German, so I couldnt talk to them). Anyway after a few weeks I ended up in hospital for attempting suicide and I was an in-patient in different hospitals and rehab-facilities until I was about 24. \nDuring this entire time my Ngma would tell family members I was faking, acting, doing this for attention, that people with BPD are always attention seekers etc (ofc the cat was out of the bag with the diagnosis at that point).\nMy mother finally stopped being an enabler at that point when she realized that ever since I had moved out my little sister was turning into the new scapegoat and Ngma was starting to do to her what she did to me. \n Sorry for the long story. Now the actual problem: \n I have been LC for years and years now, I am doing super well, married, healthy, BPD in check, absolutely fantastic mostly.. and my Ngma suddenly had a stroke and forgot that she is an asshole. \n She entirely changed. She now treats everyone the way she did me, insulting them, talking \"behind their backs\" when they are in the room etc... and she is nice to me. I saw her about 3-4 times since my wedding last year and she is happy, joyful, interested and sweet to me, realtively speaking. She still will say stuff that is hurtful, but it's mostly because her mind has been turned into stew. \n I don't know how to feel. I hate myself that I can't forgive her or let go of what she did to me for years, but she isn't even the same person anymore. It's weird.\nI don't know if I am a bad person or if I really am a BPD-monster or turning into an N because I am only thinking of myself here... I just can't let go of what she did to me and my sister. Of the endless therapy sessions  50% were about her abuse and 50% about my fathers. How do I deal with this? Am I being selfish? \n Does anyone else have any kind of similar experience of an N becoming...different? Randomly? \n I am just really confused. Sorry for this enormous wall of text. [summary]: "}

{"input_text": "I am currently running a small game (three players) with a fairly simple background plot-device: Elven zealots use the stars to read fortunes, and human astronomers or 'skymancers' predict in advance that after 4 months, the elves will be \"ordered\" to wipe out humanity. \n The party are residents of a human city (not murderhobos!) who are three amongst many trying to save the city. \n After a prolonged battle with a spellcaster from the previous game, the party tracks down the slain spellcasters base - A tower with a magical orb on the top floor which enhances all magic within it. A ring of cat's grace and a ring of invisibility had given this spellcaster an invisible, moving tower.\nThe party figure this tower will be a valuable resource for fighting elves, so they head on down and start battling up through hordes of undead and a lesser spellcaster who kept fleeing upwards to the next floor before they managed to finish him off. \n The party's ranger had shot two crits into the spellcaster, and was a little upset he hadn't killed it yet, which is fair as he was the newest player. \n The other two party members (fighter and sorcerer) had gone on a previous quest in this world, where they received cursed arrowheads - a former sword containing an ultimate evil, which had been reforged to rob it of some of its power. The evil is legendary in game, so they have not letting anyone - even the third party member - know what it truly is, incase carrying such evil around turns the populace against them. The fighter occasionally uses an arrow as a makeshift stabbing weapon, as they are incredibly powerful. \n Maybe you can see where this is going? \n When they reach the top floor, the undead spellcaster rushes into the orb and his spirit merges with it. He becomes one with the tower, a fun 'fight the room!' boss battle I'd designed. \n The ranger gets initiative, rolls to rob a demon arrow from the fighter and shoots that reforged ultimate evil into the orb. \n The ranger cheers and is delighted both IC and OOC, while the other two players stare at him in horror.\nHis character passes out, as -unbeknownst to him but known by the other two players - the arrow drains health from the user with ever swing as the weapon tries to suck the life from its wielder. \n I redesign the room battle on the fly, as a powerful demon bound into that arrowhead pulls the rest of the quiver into the orb and grows more powerful than it's ever been. \n I've never seen more horror on my player's faces as when they sat in a moment of silence and realized they'd escalated acquiring a tower for their cause into rebirthing a demon named 'Souldrinker', which had been contained by the heroes of old who'd lacked the power to destroy it, and made it more powerful than ever. \n The tower ports itself to the middle of an innocent city, pouring out undead into a gathering of halflings. \n Souldrinker explains he is going to annihilate all life, city by city, plane by plane. \n The sorceror rushes to the orb and tries to use magic device to navigate away to elven lands, hoping to at least decimate people the party doesn't like. \n The fighter has lost his arrows, but his other weapon is a magical greatsword that adapts to the properties of whatever it hits, gaining a stacking +chance to hit that caps at 2. \n I'd just like to say, I was running this all off the top of my head and hoping we didn't Total World Kill.\nThe sorceror rolls a 20 on use magic device, so I allow him to understand how to shift into the orb and be standing next to the demon. He tries to limit it's wrath and explain that if he kills everyone at once, there'll be no death left - I liked the effort and started designing things in that direction as quickly as I could, making sure to not pause as I've never seen my party so excited or co-operative in their OOC planning \n Meanwhile, the fighter tried to leap into the orb after the sorcerer, but lacking comprehension he thudded into it. I remember his buckler (strapped to his arm) was a lesser holy item, so as it touches the orb I make it freeze in place as the celestial runes along it re-write themselves. \n I then narrate the scene every high-level spellcaster they'd met going into a trance -regardless of alignment - and focusing on making this item the most powerful holy object they could \n The shield on the orbs surface casts a light into the orbs interior realm, and the sorcerer stands in that light, becoming blessed with the powers and knowledge of all the spellcasters around the gameworld (including the deceased ones, helping from other planes of existence) desperately trying to save life. \n As the shield breaks off and become a beacon for others to help them, the fighter uses his greatsword to strike the orb multiple times. I say that, having adapted, it strikes open a gap in the surface that he can crawl through, maintaining his physical form in the spirit realm without being magical. \n He crawls in as the sorcerer holds the demon back with the magic of all the friends and enemies the party had ever made (and foreshadowing of some they had yet to meet!) as the warrior walks up and uses his adaptable sword to cut this demon apart with it's own essence.

Amarok blends in well there and a pro of Amarok is that you can easily switch between Library and File view mode for your local collection (just like Foobar). Album art fetching is also good but sadly album art is not stored in the metadata so you loose it when losing your Amarok config files. If you are not on KDE Amarok is probably less nice. To be honest I also have to mention it seems a bit more 'crashy'. Not that it crashes often, just noticably more than the others I tried (YMMV). \n Clementine is a fork of the old Amarok interface. The best thing about clementine is the integration of web services if you ask me. Magnatune (you should check out that service) integration and Radio Streams are done better than Amarok does it plus Clementine supports Soundcloud out of the box! \n Rhythmbox has superb library browsing but depends heavily on proper tagging. Finding songs that are not well tagged is much harder as there is no 'folder view'. \n Audacious is great if you only need a file browsing player without Library. Light and straightforward. \n Music Player Daemon + client. That's a different beast. MPD itself has nog GUI, it's a console app. Once setup (which can be tricky at first) it is great fun.

Almost immediately after he moved in he started beating me on a daily basis, and every night for the next 4 years I prayed to \"god\" to make it stop.

By my 13th birthday I was in middle school, had starting smoking weed and was interested in philosophy, so I got high and I read what ever i could find, and I thought, I thought about everything which only reaffirmed what I had accepted as the truth, That there is no way any \"god\" can exist and let everything that's happened to me happen.

{"input_text": "The Back Story: \n My boyfriend, Sam, and I have been together on and off for the past several years. During our time together we've broken up multiple times. The breakups usually follow an argument in which we can't see eye to eye on whatever situation. \n Sam refuses to agree to disagree, and has a very hard time admitting fault in things. Sam is older than I am, and likes to tell me that I've not had much experience with successful relationships, and I'm neurotic. I might be, I don't know. \n For example, Sam has a problem with my co-workers, and resents the fact that I am close to them. I work long hours with a bunch of guys. They're like family to me, and I'm very open with him about our friendships. Sam, on the other hand, spends a ton of time on Facebook, the majority of his friends are women, and is very closed off about them. I am not his Facebook friend, am not allowed to see his friends, and if I ask about them, he calls me jealous, and this escalates into an argument. \n Sam calls me short tempered and hot headed, and once upon a time he was right. I no longer engage in arguments, and instead now shut down and walk away. It is useless to argue with someone who screams and yells at me, talks over me, exaggerates and embellishes, so I don't. Sam, on the other hand, does just that. \n When I'm driving, because Sam's car is inoperable and he can't fix it, Sam regularly comments on my driving, yelling at me from the passenger seat. I'm not a perfect driver, but nobody has died, either. I tell him to stop, and he calls me testy, or asks if I'm on my period. \n In our arguments, I'm the one who is wrong, I'm the one who likes to fight, I'm the one at fault. He tells me he's not a problem starter, but I see evidence to the contrary when he tells me how he trolls posts and comments on the internet. He used to be a gamer but fought with his guild to the point where he rage quit and never went back. \n The Current Story:\nI'm a fairly independent person who hates to rely on others or ask for help. I don't like owing people. I had to ask Sam for advice on a problem I had with my car. I picked his brain a few times over the course of a couple of days about the problem. I tried to fix it myself, but after a day in the hot sun and unsuccessful results, I called him for help. He said he was on the internet, and the tone of his voice was like I was a terrible inconvenience. I could tell I was bothering him, so I said hey, nevermind, I got it. I hung up the phone and just cried. \n My neighbor and I fixed it together, but I feel so let down, again. I know I was tired and hot and frustrated, but he makes me feel like I'm a bother and an inconvenience, and then turns around and tells me I'm crazy/PMSing when I call him on it. \n Every time I tell him how I feel, I'm told I'm wrong, or over reacting, or just crazy.

{"input_text": "As it is in 13w01b, the only reliable way to control whether a hopper will move items is with a comparator, using the trick with 16 (17?) items in the first slot and 1 in each other slot. This also requires a storage minecart, and it seems rather clunky and somewhat hacky to use all of this to make a simple sorting system. \n My proposal is that redstone current fed into a hopper controls the rate of the hoppers removing and placing items from/to connecting blocks. There are a few possible ways to implement this, such as: \n \n A hopper requires any amount of redstone power to move items; no power stops the hopper \n A hopper's item movement rate is based on the strength of the redstone current hitting it. i.e, power of 15 moves items quickly, power of 1 is very slow, no redstone current means no hopper activity (my personal favorite) \n The opposite, where supplying power stops the hopper from working entirely - like a redstone torch (power deactivates) \n \n This would simplify controlling how hoppers move items, because there is no real way of doing so currently. Only workarounds work, such as the storage minecart trick, and changes in minecarts could break this. \n A downside to this is that systems with hoppers would require a constant source of power, which would be especially annoying in lines of hoppers facing each other. However, I think that it would make sense for such a useful block to require some sort of power to work rather than just moving items freely. [summary]: "}

{"input_text": "Bit of a background first.. \n Bought a SR7007 about a year ago from Amazon. When I opened it up and laid eyes upon the beautiful unit I was more than excited to hook it up. The second I plugged it in, my excitement was forever diminished. \n First issues I had were trying to get it to do a firmware update out of the box. It was stuck in a start-up loop. Call to the friendly guys at Marantz, a processor reset, and I was back and running. \n The real issues began when I started using the unit. Randomly the unit would power off and flash the front led red. Weird. Turned it back on and it was fine for another few days. Then it happened again, and again. Hours of Googling later, I discovered that it was going into protect mode. Why? No idea. \n The issues stopped for a few months and I finally was able to enjoy my beautiful unit. Then it started again. It came to a point that it wouldn't power on more than a few seconds at a time. Turn it on, front display come on then  click . \n Many calls to Marantz later, I was told to take it in for service. An hour drive to my nearest authorized service center and it was dropped off. Thankfully I have my old, trusty Onkyo to hold me over until I got it back. Couldn't be more than a week, right? \n A solid month later I get a call to come pick up my unit. I was told it was something with the bias transistors and they were replaced. Cool. I was good to go again. \n Got it home, hooked up and I was off running. Not even a day later -  click . Same thing. It had to have been a fluke, no problem. Ran it for a day then  click . Powered it back on  click . Sigh. Back to the shop it goes. I called Marantz and managed to get hold of the head technician over there. Told me he'd personally call the service center and see what's going on. My last bit of faith was renewed as they seem pretty good at getting to the bottom of this. In the midst of this before I actually made the haul back down to drop it off, they had me do some diag and figured out it was going into 'Thermal Protect B'. Weird. I have it in an adequate cabinet with a fan unit on top in a push/pull config. It's powering only my fronts with the pre-out to my sub. Never gets more than warm to the touch. \n A speedy turn around of a week this time and I get a call to head on down to get it. Guy explains to me that there was a recall on the unit that something on the board was causing it to trip and go into protect. Part was replaced and tested. Sweet. This was finally fixed. \n I take it back home, unplug the Onkyo and put it back in. It powers up and I'm off to the races \n Two days later..  click . Are you f'ing kidding me? I immediately submit a new support ticket to Marantz as that seems to be the fastest and most direct way to get to the head tech over there. I specifically ask for him in the ticket. I didn't yell, or lose my cool. I simply state exactly how I have it hooked up and what's going on with it. \n He responds and has the audacity to immediately say that it might be working as intended. Ludicrous. I hastily reply that if that was how it's supposed to be working, you need new engineers. I get word to take it back to the service center for a third time. \n A few days pass and he responds to me that the guy at the service center managed to get it to fail in the exact manner I presented. He apologizes and gives me an option to try to replace the Amp/HDMI board (as he thinks that's the culprit) or get a refurb unit. I go the refurb route as I think I must have gotten a lemon. \n A week passes and I get my refurb unit. Looks brand new. I get over-excited and don't bother to test it before I place it back in my system. I go to power it on - LCD lights up, Amp clicks on then it restarts. Fuck. \n It's now stuck in a continuous start-up loop. I yank it out of my system and let it sit for 30mins to let the electricity drain from it. Plug it back in and same thing. I now take a video of this phenomenon as I'm sure they won't believe me this time. \n I submit my ticket and wait to hear back. After some back and forth they decide to go ahead and upgrade me to the SR7008 for my troubles. Refurb, but still. They shoot me a shipping label to send it back. I box it up and get it out the next day. \n Now let the waiting commence. \n I get a call from United Audio which is the place I apparently shipped it back to. They ask me why it's there. I just told them it was Marantz instructed me to do and get a hold of them. They pretty much refuse and tell me to call them to figure out what's going on. Okay, no problem. \n I reply to my now lengthy ticket and tell them it's there. Then.. nothing. \n My last reply from anyone at Marantz to my ticket was on 08.21. I've sent them numerous replies. Still nothing. United Audio sent me a letter recently telling me to respond to them as to what's wrong with the unit or in 30 days they're mailing it back to me and charging me shipping. \n Absolutely ridiculous. I have zero unit in hand and can't really do anything about it. I've put off calling them directly, again, as I'm sure I'll get another run-around. \n I'm genuinely hoping this is a fluke and not how they normally handle operations. Thanks for the read!

{"input_text": "Hey guys. So today, I just found out that my father's cheating on my mom. I've had this suspicion months ago but just I wasn't sure yet. Just today, I heard him on the phone talking to a girl and say \"I love you\", and my mom was sleeping at that time. \n Almost every night, he goes upstairs only after 11 or 11:30PM. Everytime I go outside my room, he's usually on the phone talking softly to, who I assume, the girl. He has a spare cellphone which he uses to text/talk with the girl, and it's always with him. It's the only phone that is password protected. \n My father's the one that's providing us financially so I don't really know what to do.. Should I tell my sisters (I have 3) or my mother straight? Or should I confront him? If so, how should I? [summary]: "}
{"input_text": "Alright then! I should have seen this one coming considering our time spent together before this date mostly consisted of her using me as a taxi service. Oh, and I later found out she had been pregnant with my roommate's boyfriend's child a few months prior to us meeting. \u0ca0_\u0ca0 \n But I digress... \n Ignoring the rough start (I hadn't seriously dated in a couple years due to a really bad break up and assumed it's always rocky in the beginning) I decided to take her out for a nice night. You know, dress up, get dinner, ???????, Profit! That kind of deal. We were broke college kids so this was rare. Well the night goes great and after the planned activities it was still early so I offered to take her shopping. (Well, she had hinted at wanting to.) \n Big mistake. \n We went to a few stores and then end up in a major department store. She takes a few (pricey) items into the changing rooms to \"try on\". So, here I am sitting outside, dressed to the nines, happy as a clam playing on my phone when people start queuing up outside of the changing room. Specifically two women talking loudly about what they wanted to do for dinner. I look up from my phone and smile at them but go right back to playing whatever game I was playing. \n FINALLY she comes out but with nothing in hand. I'm too absorbed in how well the date was going to give it much thought past, \"Hmm, that's odd.\" and just assumed she left the expensive items in the dressing room as some rude customers often do. AS SOON as we cross the threshold of the exit enter the two loud women from before running to our sides, telling us not to run, that they are loss prevention officers and they need us to come with them. \n I know  exactly  what's happening now. They lead us back into the store and while we're walking the woman escorting me asks if I know why we're being stopped. Knowing  exactly  what's happening, of course I say \"no\". We finally reach a women's section where they take her through a mysterious back door and ask me to sit in a chair that's typically set aside for husbands waiting for wives to finish trying things on. I sit there for  over  an hour. No one was watching me, no one told me what was happening, nothing. I could have left at any time but part of me was just too curious to leave because now several police officers and mall security have entered the mysterious door. Not one of them even looked at me. \n FINALLY the woman who escorted me walks out with a portly cop and the girl's purse in hand (the purse was stolen from somewhere else by the way). They ask me to take care of her belongings and tell me that she is going to jail AND that they were SORRY I was involved but that I needed to leave. \n Turns out she got charged for theft in excess of $500 and spent the night in jail.

{"input_text": "TTGL For similar reasons as the other guy in this thread but I feel like elaborating. \n Had through out high school (and still have today) pretty bad depression. I would often compare myself to others and find myself lacking in every department. It didn't get much better when I entered college and found myself at a real low point. I didn't see a future for myself and really wondered what I was doing with my life. \n one day I heard some friends talking about a show called \"Gurren Lagann\" and how cool it was. It was on netflix at the time so I decided to watch it. I immediately found myself connecting with Simon, his feelings of isolation and that he couldn't do anything right. Surprisingly it was some of the cheesiest lines that helped me. Growing up I always heard \"Just believe in your self\" hundreds of times from countless sources, and if you have ever had depression you know that basically sounds like \"Just don't be sick\" or \"just don't have a broken leg\". But the line \"believe in the you that believes in you\" struck me a lot differently. It was saying that it was ok that I couldn't believe in myself, but to hope that one day I would. For the first time in my life I was told it was ok to feel this way but to not give up hope. Then as i saw Simon grow and change throughout the show, I felt my confidence grow with him. \n The stupid lines became My mantras to get through everyday life. Whenever my mind said \"this is impossible\" a little voice would immediately comeback with \"sometimes in life you have to kick logic out and do the impossible\". I found myself listening to Libera me from Hell whenever i needed motivation to do something, form writing a paper, to just getting up in the morning. TTGL made me feel like as long as I kept moving forward, even small bits at a time(like a drill) I could do anything, beat any challenge, move past any set back. It didn't cure my depression, but it gave me the tools to start dealing with it. And that's why its my favorite show of all time. [summary]: "}

{"input_text": "This reminds me of an extremely long, boring story that nobody should read as there is no entertainment factor whatsoever. \n The year was 2011.  I was 21 at the time and attended my first baseball game with a friend, his girlfriend, and his girlfriends single, uglier friend who was too interested in me which is unfortunate because I wasn't interested in her whatsoever.  She continuously tried to make moves all night but I just couldn't get into her.  She was gross and If I remember correctly, smelled of body odor which resembled fried pickles with a hint of grilled onions. \n Anyway, we decided to sit in the homerun section.  As stated earlier this was my first baseball game and I was ecstatic. I don't know why exactly.  It was a local minor league team with virtually no good players whatsoever.  The one player that was good, however, was REALLY good.  He hit home runs all the time according to his stats which is a terrible thing to say considering I know nothing about baseball.  I've tried to watch it on TV a few times but couldn't get into it. I know nothing of the numbers they post next to the players face.  I know a bit about football and basketball though.  I'm more of an NCAA football fan than I am NFL.  But when it comes to Basketball, the NBA is the shit.  Kevin Durant is by far my favorite player.  He's a real humble dude.  I met him a few times and he was also really nice.  I can't actually say that as I only met his body guards a few times because it's frowned upon to look at celebrities and ask to hang out apparently. But he treated his security with respect and they must like him well enough to stick around so I'd say hes a pretty nice guy overall. \n Anyway.  So I'm at this baseball game in the home run section.  It's hot outside and we were sipping on beers.  All they had was budweiser, bud light, and like miller high life.  I won't be an ass and say I'm a beer snob but when it comes to beer, I really like my expensive shit if I can afford it at the time.  Right now, unfortunately I can't as I just quit my job recently.  The new company I work for doesn't pay half as well as the other one so I had to make a few cut backs.  I don't drink much anyway so it isn't a problem. When I do drink, however, I gotta say, my favorite is Sam Smith's Nut Brown Ale.  I once bought a case of 12, pint sized bottles for 80 bucks cause I'm a damn sucker...the liquor store had to ship it over seas but it's whatever...Worth it. \n So anyway, I'm at a baseball game sitting in the home run section drinking a bud light when the only guy that can hit a homerun approaches the plate. It's hot outside and the crowd is going wild for this kid.  I guess I can't really say he's a kid.  I think he was mid 30 or something?  It was odd to me because I always heard if you're 30 in your sports career, your past your prime.  I guess this makes sense as to why he was in the minor league.  Maybe the pay was alright.  Maybe he was just in it for the game.  I have no idea.  I know I wouldn't be 30 and playing baseball with a bunch of damn kids.  I guess I can't really say that considering I'm only 25 now...I guess I could compare it to my current job considering I do work with a lot of high school students.  Ugh these kids piss me off to no end.  They're lay and have no real work ethic.  Everything is too hard for them.  Back in my day, if it was impossible, you fucking tried until you were on the edge of heat stroke.  Only then, was it to hard.  That's when you called your corn fed cousin who was twice the man you were to come help you do whatever the hell it is you were supposed to be doing by yourself in the first place.  He comes over and handles it himself then looks at you and says \"That wasn't so hard!\" \n Whatever, anyway...So I'm sitting in the hot summer day in the homerun section of the baseball game next to a woman that smells of fried pickles and onions with a bud light in hand.  The player approaches the homerun base and the crowd is going wild. I didn't know what to expect since I wasn't having too much fun at this point and time but I couldn't help but sit at the edge of my seat.  The pitcher throws a fast ball and you hear the crack of the bat hitting the 80 mph fast ball.  I swear it sounded just like firecrackers on the forth of July! I know the sound well considering I was hit in the leg by a mortar when I was 11 years old.  My stupid cousins are running around having a roman candle fight next to the firecrackers.  One of the idiots ran past the shogun rockets, mortars pile and the other one took aim and fired.  It sent the whole pile reeling in a beautiful terrifying fountain of colors and explosion. One of the 25 pack of colored small mortar tipped over and started firing rapidly at everyone while spinning in a circle due to the force of the rockets flying out.  The stupid box aimed right at me and fired POW! Came smashing right into my jeans.  The flame burned a whole through my jeans, the flame bounces away, extinguishes, and all that's left is an 11 year old me screaming.  My parents came over and gathered me, took me inside and oddly enough put mustard on my burn.  It relieved the pain quickly and we were good to go! \n So anyway, while sitting at the game sipping my budlight next to some smelly Fiona from Shrek looking since friend of my buddies girlfriend, the pitches throws an 80 mph fastball.  The batter that everyone was screaming for HITS the ball as hard as he can and sends it sailing through the sky right at me! At this point I'm having flashback to my childhood.  I was a fairly active child with a few older cousins that loved to play sports.  One of them wanted to teach me how to throw a baseball.  I'm left handed, he was right handed, which proved to be a bit of a challenge for him.  All he had was regular left handed mits.  I didn't know how to catch left handed necessarily as my first reaction was to reach with my right hand.  So my cousin throws this ball really high in the air for an easy lob catch.  As it's coming down, I completely bypass using the hand with the glove on it to catch the stupid ball and tried to catch it with my right hand.  The stupid ball missed my tiny 5 year old hands and hit me straight in the eye.  Pain and screams...Sort of like smalls from the sandlot ya know? It was terrible.  I had a good shiner for about a week after that one. \n So the batter hit this damn ball with the force of 1000 Spartans, the crack was probably heard all through downtown, and the crowd was in complete awe! The ball comes careening towards me at a very very high lob and I don't know what to do considering I never fully learned how to catch a ball.  I watch this ball screaming towards me, kept my eye on the ball as my cousin stated, and watched as this stupid ball fell right at me. My friend, his girlfriend, and his girlfriends smelly single girlfriend that was into me even though I wasn't into her split real fucking fast when they saw the ball headed our way which left me there sitting by myself in somewhat of a fetal position with both of my hands up in the air, eyes on the ball... \n Stupid ball missed my hands and hit me straight in the knee and bounced off.  My knee swelled up the size of a softball ironically enough.  I tried to run after it but fell on my face since I couldn't walk from the injury I just sustained. Some old man came slinking down the stairs, wearing a hat, a baseball button up shirt, sunglasses and khaki shorts, grabbed the ball, looked at me, said \"Finders keepers\" and hobbled off! \n Despite being in pain, I had to sit and laugh at that...

{"input_text": "I'll keep this as short as possible without leaving out any relevant info. We were best friends in high school. I asked her out first year of college and we were long distance until this June. But we frequently saw each other as she would visit our hometown or I would visit her at college 2 hours away. We've been together 4 years next month, engaged since mid July. \n She and I had never drank. I didn't do it because I'm honestly somewhat afraid to see what I am like-- alcoholism runs in my family and they turn into douches. I went to some parties in college but didn't enjoy them really, just went for the company. She doesn't drink because her parents are very religious and would look down on it if their only daughter was out at bars drinking. \n She had drank some wine once during a snow day but for some reason felt she needed to keep it a secret from me. She eventually did mention it in passing and I told her it was fine, asked what it tasted like etc. It was no problem. Then she got a new best girl friend her senior year who does drink. I found out in passing again that my fiancee drinks when they go out to eat sometimes. Ok...I would have rather have not been kept in the dark but not a huge deal. She tells me she just drinks fruity stuff with low alcohol content because she can't stand the taste of alcohol. We drank champagne once together shortly after moving in together. I got buzzed unknowingly because I drank it pretty quick. \n About a month ago that friend (whom I had never met in person previously) came to visit and my fiancee and her went out to lunch together, then went shopping for a few hours. They came back and were in another room talking about dinner. I was getting my shoes on, assuming I was invited because her friends bf was going too. \n My fiancee had previously asked me to leave for the weekend so they could spend time together. I found someone I could stay with for a night but couldn't go over quite yet. \n My fiancee says her friends bf is a douche so I probably won't enjoy it anyway. I insist because I've never met him and have barely gotten to speak to her best friend. So we go, bf is definitely a jerk and doesn't say a word. Fiancee drinks a tiny bit of beer but I can tell she feels awkward. \n We get back to the apartment and I ask to speak to her in private, she declines as nicely as possible and it felt so weird. I left feeling like something was wrong with our relationship and she just wasn't ready to tell me yet. I call her in the car and insist to speak to her. I tell her that I didn't expect her to drink, it was no problem but I told her I'm glad I went to dinner and such and apologized for not drinking with them and for seeming kind of panicked, and that I had been thinking she was having doubts. We hung up on a good note. \n She texted me periodically through the night, and at 2 AM said they were getting ready for bed. I tell her I'll come back over in the AM and be real quiet to not wake them up. I get there at 830 and her friend is already gone. She sleeps in until about 1:30 and wakes up to me next to her. I asked what they did and if they had fun and she just laughed a little, I figured they just goofed around and caught up with each other at the apartment and thought nothing of it. \n The next day we go to dinner and I realize I was kinda curious what they did, so I asked again. She laughed again, I asked again and she said they went out drinking at a country bar/concert hall. \n I was pretty hurt that she had still kept that a secret from me. We got to dinner, I didn't have anything to say and when we finally got in bed later I told her I wasn't mad at her, just disappointed she still didn't tell me. And they drove. I told her she needed to be safe if she was gonna drink, and I'd rather know where she was just in case something goes wrong I'd know her last location. She agrees and tells me I shouldn't worry, that she doesn't drink to the point of drunkenness and only fruity drinks anyway. \n Fast forward to this weekend, she went to her previous college town to spend time with that same best friend who recently broke up with her bf of 9 years. They went out to eat last night around 9. I'm looking forward to the rare almost-full day I get with her this Sunday and order some bath bombs as a surprise. I asked how it was and got a text at midnight saying \" __  was great. I'll talk with you late. Love you!\" \n I asked if I could talk to her on the phone before bed. I'm sick right now and just wanted to hear her voice and know she was alright. \n \"Nope. It's a girls weekend. :) Wynonna took me out. I'll call you in the morning. Love you! \ud83d\ude18\" \n That's strange and not usually how she texts, and now I know from the text they're going drinking so I'm thinking she is tipsy/drunk and doesn't want me to hear her voice. I ask if I can call later. \n \"We aren't going to be home until late. I'll text you :) \" \n Okay, close enough. I tell her to have fun, be safe, and tell her I'll be awake. She says she will be safe, we both say I love you. \n An hour later I get another kiss emoji and ask \"Babe are you tipsy lol\" \n Her reply is \"Yes lol Don't worry, we have an uber lol\" \n I tell her I'd really like to hear her before bed, and this is when I tell her I've been sick all night (Papa John's...damn you). We talk about my symptoms, she never answers the question but I don't realize it. It's 2:17 AM, bars are closed and I ask if they're in the Uber. \n She says no. I ask if she's drunk or just tipsy. She says she doesn't know for sure. I tell her I'd like to call when I get a chance, 30 minutes later I get a selfie of her and she says she's back at her friend's apartment. I try to call, no answer so I fall asleep. \n She texts me this morning and then we talk on the phone. I asked if she knows if she was drunk or not (very casual conversation, I wasn't interrogating her). She says she doesn't think so because she remembers everything. I explain she could still be drunk without being blackout drunk. She says she was probably drunk then. She tells me the 2 places they went when I ask, and I tell her to enjoy the football game she's attending today and we will both do something fun together tomorrow. She's been at the game and hasn't really talked to me much today. \n Am I crazy for thinking that her drinking has escalated really quickly? I just found out a few weeks ago that she went to a bar, then last night she's getting drunk...and still being secretive it seems. \n I trust her. But people are different when they're drunk. And obviously some guys like to target drunk girls. I have never seen my fiancee even tipsy, and only seen her drink twice (the champagne, then the beer sip). I am thinking about us going to drink together tomorrow so I can see what it's like and maybe help my anxiety about her drinking. \n Does anyone else see the secrecy as an issue or am I overreacting? I don't really know how to approach it without her feeling like I'm controlling or suffocating her. I love this woman and I want her to be safe and her getting drunk seems so unlike her that I don't know what to do. [summary]: "}

To buy a select fire AR-15/M-16 is going to cost thousands of dollars if you can even find a legal one. \n Both the receiver (which was one of the parts the OP plated with gold) and the sear are considered machine guns by US law.  Drilling a hole for a select-fire option on a modern receiver constitutes intent to create a machine gun and is illegal.  Possession of a drop in sear which could convert the weapon to fully automatic is for all intents and purposes illegal (you would have to prove that it was manufactured before 1986, and most that actually were manufactured at that time were not serialized).  Theoretically you could own one so long as you don't actually possess an AR pattern rifle, but even this is legally iffy. [summary]: "}

{"input_text": "It was day 3 of a 6 day 50 mile backpacking trip in the Eagle Cap Wilderness and we were coming down from one of the first high passes. Myself and three of the other guys I was with (7 total on the trip) decided that instead of taking the trail we would slide on the snow, A fun way to get down moderate inclines in the summer months. It started out ok, just a mild slope and we were having a good time. All of a sudden the train started to get much steeper, so much so that you couldn't see the bottom. We were too far from the trail to turn around and decided that the best thing to do would be carefully traverse the snow field cutting in our own switchbacks as needed. As we started going we spaced out and took careful steps to ensure good footing however I wasn't being careful enough and lost my footing. Normally I would have probably just slid a bit regained my footing and moved on being sure to be more careful. However my 50lb pack threw my balance off and I fell down and started sliding down the slope. There was a large boulder (20 feet across) in the center of the the snowfield and I, in my panic, was trying everything to keep from hitting it. I rolled onto my side facing away from it and tried fruitlessly to change my trajectory. I ended up slamming into the rock with my pack first and because it was August there was a significant gap around the rock where the radiant heat from the dark rock had melted back the show and I got stopped. As I realized that nothing was seriously hurt (only a scraped up face from dragging on the snow and ice) I stood up, looked up the hill to the others and let them know I was ok. Then I made what was arguably the biggest mistake I looked down the hill. As I was now more than halfway down I could see the bottom and all of the jagged rocks that I would have ended up on if not for this one boulder to save me. In total I slid for probably 100' and would have slid for 100' more to what certainly would have been a nasty situation in the backcountry had it not been for the one rock. This really put into perspective what can happen when you aren't careful and are in a remote location, I had to sit there and really contemplate what could have happened if things had turned out differently while waiting for the others to catch up. As it was my scraped up face was only a mild inconvenience and we had a very good trip after that. [summary]: "}
{"input_text": "I'm not sure what I'm doing in posting this, and I apologize in advance for the length... I guess I just would like if someone here could maybe help me sort through what is up with my family. I've been trying to put the pieces together to figure out why everything I read in this sub seems so familiar to me despite the fact that I actually think my (biological, I do have an Nstepmom, but that's a whole other story) parents actually care about my well-being. \n I guess I should start by explaining the situation with my immediate family. My mom has obviously got symptoms of BPD, which caused me issues growing up. She left my dad for no apparent reason that either or he or I can figure out (quite frankly, he's the best guy I've ever seen her with - the rest have been abusive, and downright scary) when I was 7. Long story short, there was much upheaval until I was about 10, when my dad met Nstepmom, and my mom met the drug addict abusive guy who fathered my sister, then there was even more upheaval, for me at least. Mom obviously favored my sister, and has even said on occasion that she was disappointed at how I looked when I was born, stating that she expected me to have my dad's blonde hair and blue eyes (traits my sister somehow ended up with despite the fact that her father was not blonde), and was disappointed when I looked, well, just like her. From the moment my little sister was born, I knew she was the favorite, and she still is. I can deal with that though, as my mom tries her best to downplay the favoritism (this is why I don't think she's N, because despite having a lot of behaviors in common with narcissists, she actually seems to have a conscience and to actually care about others - she is just often too wrapped up in her own feelings to consider those of others, as those with BPD are wont to do). \n I guess what I'm trying to figure out is where my mom's behaviors came from, and with some things going on with her side of the family lately, I think it's starting to become clearer. My mom has 7 brothers and sisters, and according to all of them, my grandparents on that side were perfect parents. However, the behavior exhibited by my mother and my 7 aunts and uncles says otherwise. It seems like FLEAS all over the place. Recently this just became glaringly obvious to me, as they've decided that one of my cousins (age 12) is suddenly their new family SG. According to what I've been told, I previously held that place, but I have been LC with that entire side of the family ever since two of them blew up on me on facebook for no reason over a year ago. I got lambasted for talking about computer viruses and how to avoid them, which my uncle for some reason took as a personal attack because I disagreed with his belief that people on his friends list using facebook apps could somehow give  him  a virus, which resulted in him sending me verbally abusive messages then blocking me so I couldn't respond. After that, and a similar freakout from one of my aunts, I just decided that it might be best not to communicate much with that side of the family at all, which was easy since they all live pretty far away and my only contact with them has been through facebook. I have since deleted all of them from my friends list, and even made a second facebook account under a fake name so I can enjoy participating in facebook with my actual friends without my family hunting me down to harass me. \n That said, they've been attacking my aunt about her son (my aforementioned cousin), saying how she is not raising him properly and he will grow up to be a criminal, etc. etc., and my mom says that it used to be me they said this about, attacking my mother's parenting of me (she just told me this recently, which has made it clear to me that part of my issues growing up is that she actually seemed to have partly believed what they were saying, and treated me accordingly like a \"bad kid,\" which compounded with Nstepmom doing the same to me, since my parents had joint custody). Additionally, I went to visit this same aunt when I was 13 and her SO at the time raped me while I was there. My mother had to pretty much force me to tell her what happened, and when she tried to confront him about it, the entire family (yes, all of them, not just those involved) accused me of lying and accused my mom of \"trying to cause problems\" in my aunt's relationship. \n Add to this that the same uncle who sent me verbally abusive messages on facebook then blocked me has been sending my mother verbally abusive messages over some other petty thing (which she's pissed about, though when he did it to me she said, \"oh that's just how he  is !\"), and to the fact that I started discussing this issue with my father, and he pointed out to me that he always found it strange how my maternal grandmother never seemed interested in her grandkids or her kids when we visited, preferring instead to lavish attention on her pets, I'm starting to think grandma was an N. I never knew the woman. She died when I was 8, and all I remember about her is the food she cooked when we visited her (she lived 3,000 miles from us, and I think we visited about 5 or 6 times before she died). \n So, if you managed to read through all this craziness, what do you think? Is it likely my grandmother was a narcissist? It just seems like all of her children are exhibiting these N behaviors and I can't seem to figure out why else it would be happening. I know it seems odd, but understanding this helps me have some closure, since I've pretty much gone NC with that side of the family (my mother excluded; I keep some contact with her), and I just want to understand the reason for all this insanity.

After a couple of range trips she starts asking to shoot my .40 and my 9mm pistol. So the next time we went out I brought my CZ Duty and about 100 rounds of 9mm, as well as her walther.

These include saying something which causes a clear danger to public safety, such as shouting \"bomb\" or \"fire\" where no bomb or fire existed. Similarly, at least in the United States, \"fighting words\" are not protected if an impartial bystander would think those words likely to provoke an immediate violent response. Further, law does not generally protect language which is used to whip a mob into violence. \n However, I think this misses the mark. The kind of line that Booost was most likely talking about is not one of law at all. Rather, it is one of common decency.

{"input_text": "Hello, \n I just need some advice or just some thoughts on this issue. A close friend of mine is/was in an affair with an married (older) man. He is her trainer and the affair started roughly six month ago. \n She is not in love with him, but does like him as a friend and trainer. He is head over heels in love with her, but knows about her standpoint. Or at least should know, because although she's making herself very clear, he just seems to ignore it. He sends her love letters and gifts, gets jealous and talks about their future. My friend tried everything from a stern talk to yelling at him to make him stop that and realise there will be no future for them, at least not in a romantic way. \n I already had my problems being there for her during that time, but now there's more.. Now my friend has a crush on another man and things are looking good, so they might become a couple. She told her trainer/affair about him and basically ended the affair. But they still see each other during the training and she still wants him as a platonic friend. \n And now the trainer, I think he lost it. He calls her in the middle of the night, crying (an almost fifty years old man!), begging her to stay with him, telling her how much she means to him, while at the same time calling her selfish and fake, but she's also the most wonderful woman he ever met etc. etc. \n And my friend can't handle this anymore. She feels sorry for the trainer, but wants to be with her new friend. She feels guilty and mad at the same time and she is also worried her trainer might badmouth her, since he knows her new friend. \n She asks me about my opinion and for help. But I just don't know what to think of this. \n My honest opinion: I think the trainer is pathetic. IMO he's a cheater and a coward and now acts like I would expect someone like this to act.

I absolutely think he could try to damage my friends new relationship. But maybe I'm biased. \n I never worded it that way, but I guess my dislike kinda showed, because when I mention anything about him, my friend gets defensive and excuses him. I just don't understand her. I don't understand what she sees in him, why he ist still so important to her. Why she would even feel attracted to someone so pitiful. \n I also think it's at least morally questionable to start an affair with someone in a LTR. I try not to judge her, but I can't help but feel like she kind of brought that upon herself? The whole situation just makes me angry, at everyone involved. \n And I don't want to be angry with her, I want to help and support her, but I'm really lost for words. My valuable contribution to our conversations reagarding this topic were listening to her, mmh-ing and repeating \"That sounds complicated.\", \"That must be so difficult.\", \"I'm sorry.\" and, you know, I supect I'm not really helping and I also don't feel good about holding back my honest feelings about this mess. \n So I guess my question is: what can I say to help?

When the Joker announces on the intercom that each boat has the detonator for the other boat, I believe he is lying and that the boats are given the detonators to their own boats. Then, in an effort to save themselves, the people on the boat would end up being responsible for their own deaths.

{"input_text": "I would very much have liked to remain as a lurker on this subreddit after just having found it today but I do not think I can stay silent on something that I have thought much about.  As a student of science I realize that there are many scientific studies that back the existence of homosexual people.  But as somebody else brought up in this thread, there is a distinction between the acts of homosexuality and actually being homosexual.  I do believe that the act is a sin but I do not believe that being homosexual is a sin.  God made us all and all sin is equal in His eyes regardless if it's petty theft, pornography/lust, or acts of homosexuality. \n I have thought long and hard about this and realized that in the end Western Christianity has placed such a heavy emphasis on homosexuality as a sin because the majority of us do not understand it.  Humans as a general rule fear what we do not understand ... in general, Christians understand lust, they understand greed, they understand covetousness.... but homosexuality is something that many do not understand and therefore it's a 'poster sin' in a sense.  It makes me angry to see so many Christians/churches turning away self-identified homosexuals away from the church because of this misguided (imo) belief regarding homosexuality.  A homosexual Christian would abstain from sexual relations as much as a single heterosexual Christian would abstain from lust/pornography. \n If I were to ever have a child, this is how I would explain it to them.  \"Are you not going to be friends with Joey because he's gay but you're okay with being friends with Zack even though he steals?\"  Acts of homosexuality is a sin... But ALL sin is equal in the sight of God.  But I realize now that I have deviated from the original question by quite a bit.  In response to the original question of \"Why does God hate homosexuality\"... who are we to question what God has decreed?  I know that this will probably not be a satisfactory answer, but it all comes down to whether or not we believe God is sovereign and whether or not we follow His decrees.  I'm not saying that we should hate homosexuals (read first two paragraphs) but I honestly believe that God loves those He has called, whether they are homosexuals or heterosexuals or ... whatever.  But at the same time, His decrees are absolute and perfect. [summary]: "}

Over the course of several competitive playlist games, some strangers and I successfully managed to shut down a 'troll, toxic player, harasser, griefer,' or whatever you want to call them. \n The Story \n I was playing on my own today, and ran into a prototypical unpleasant RL player, lets call him or her \"Bubbles,\" who was placed on my team. We scored our first goal after a defender just kinda flopped and missed the ball. Bubbles took the opportunity to start spamming \"what a save!\" In this situation, as the defender, I usually just respond with \"Thanks!\" trying to keep the lighthearted nature of the game, and working under the assumption that they're just poking fun at how we can make silly mistakes sometimes. When Bubbles started doing this after  every  goal, no matter how close the defender was, I finally called them out and just said, \"you're being a dick. Stop.\" Commence full troll mode; the typical shit. We ended up winning, but what I should have done is what the next team paired with Bubbles did. This time I was matched against Bubbles, and the other team immediately warned us about him or her. I noted how I had also run into them previously, and pretty soon all five players other than Bubbles was basically just talking about all these awful experiences they had. That's some pretty consistent harassment if you can actually get matched with FIVE people down the road who recognize you for misbehavior. The opposing team agreed that they didn't feel a ladder win was worth playing with this person, and less so worth trying to give Bubbles a win of their own. So they effectively stopped playing at all, and we did the same, except for saving Bubbles' shot attempts. After a short while of a 0-0 game, they forfeited and Bubbles actually remained completely silent. \n The Implications \n Let's face it, even the meanest and trolliest of us actually  don't  like it when we're not liked by others. Even by strangers. In this case, we clearly had some sort of psychological impact on Bubbles. The desired effect was to upscale others' faults and boost his or her own image; but it backfired entirely. Eventually, we had an entire community of people who simply rejected Bubbles and moved on the the next activity. If anything, I just hope that this is a small lesson about what happens when you choose to behave that way, even to people behind a username. Now, is this going to work every time a troll comes along? Definitely not. There are children and adults on every game server who will use anonymity to act out. But let's face it, the toxicity of the playerbase is, ultimately,  our  responsibility, and not Psyonix's. It's one of the very few things we have some control over, and this is a team game.

{"input_text": "So tonight me and a few other frients decided that we wanted to smoke, unfortunately we had no weed on us at all. We call up our dealer and make plans to meet out at a usually crowded public place. We arrive at the spot around 10:40 and call our dealer to make sure he is coming, whom says he will be there in 10 minutes. So we are waiting around and waiting and 20 minutes pass by and he doesn't show up. We then proceed to wait around for another 10 minutes to in case he does decide to show up...still not there, so we leave. \n Unfortunately what I did not notice as the driver was that all the windows were very foggy because of the coldness of the outside and the body heat from the inside (I turned off the car that way I didn't burn gas and there wasn't just a random car sitting there running). As we are leaving about to get on the highway those dreaded red and blue flashing lights come on directly behind us. \n Now this was only my second time being pulled over ever (knock on wood), so I was extremely nervous. As well we had my grinder on me and a couple of papers and blunts, but other then that we had nothing on us. The cop then comes up and we go through the whole routine of why he pulled me over (apparently I had forgotten to use my blinker to change lanes) and the whole license and registration routine. Then he proceeds to ask why the windows were so foggy, so I explained why because of the cold and body heat. \n He asks if we had anything on us and if we had been smoking (which we hadn't due to the lack of dealer), of course my first rection to this question is no, he then asks again, and then I start thinking to myself...I would rather tell him the truth and get searched and have nothing else on us, then lie and be searched and get arrested for a fucking grinder. So I answer him that we have a grinder on us but that is it, no other drugs or marijuana related paraphernalia on us. As he is running my information me and my friends are thinking that we are about to be screwed because of just a tiny grinder. \n After about 5 minutes waiting he the comes back with my license and registration and then starts asking if we were meeting anyone there or if we had people jumping in and out of the cars or dropping anyone off for any reason. Then about 3 other cops walk up to the car, all of which none of my friends had noticed that they pulled up. The other 3 cops ask my friends to roll there windows down because its still foggy in my car and they cant see them, at this point we know they are just trying to bust some kids for smoking weed or having it on them. One of the cops asks the one that pulled us over what he wanted to do...my heart is about to burst out of my chest I was scared shitless...he then tells them nothing and didn't have anything on us or we weren't smoking and tells us we are free to go. I tell him thank you officer, have a nice night, and be safe. And as I'm pulling onto the highway my friend then asks if he even gave me a ticket, fortunately for me he didn't but at the same time it just solidifies that he was trying to bust some kids for weed. And I am still stone cold sober as I type this, but couldn't be happier under the circumstances. \n After this went down and I dropped my friends off I called up my dealer and thanked him a million times for not showing up. All from this I have learned to never pick up in public places again, and would say to others to never do it only as a last resort, even then I would be extremely cautious. [summary]: "}

{"input_text": "I'd disagree that settling on resources is generally a good strategy. When you settle a city on a tile, it sets minimum yield to 2 food and 1 production, but keeps anything higher, so that if you settle plains or grasslands you get that, but if you settle hills you get 2 food 2 production, since the hill already had 2 production. So, if you settle resources, be they luxury, strategic, or bonus, the same thing happens; settling stone will grant the extra production if it's in plains or a hill, settling that cotton will give two gold, etc. However, these resources are not just valuable by themselves, or else bonus resources would be pointless. They also lead to better tiles, not only because of increased yield outright, but a new option for tile improvement. In the case of cotton, this is a plantation, which gives +1 gold, and +1 food once fertilizer is researched. So, if you settle the cotton, your city tile has 2 food, 1 production, 2 gold, a net benefit of 1 production for settling there, and you may work, say, the flood plains you would've settled, for 3 food. However, settling one tile next to it gives 2 food 1 production, but you may also work the cotton tile, giving 3 gold and 3 food. So, in the end, you're left with 1 more gold total for not settling the cotton.

Terrorists have next to no options, with the ones they have being terrible, only being beaten by Aztec in CT sided. \n -Snipers Nest & Underpass/Overpass- \n The most requested change would be to the sniper nest area & the staircase connecting underpass with overpass, the addition of the stairwell was a good change in :GO, but it wasn't enough. \n Door or not, terrorists are exposed to dozens of angles as soon as they step out, with no cover to get behind making the AWP & Scoped weapons highly powerful on the open areas, the most obvious being snipers nest. I believe along with other map makers that adding a wood plank concealing visibility from the \"middle\" area of the map (on the door exit) but still climbable & wallbangable would fix the issue of accessing the bridge being a death sentence. \n de_dust_hype includes the change mentioned above, as now i will be covering the more controversial topic, a second sniper nest/backroute for terrorists to enter. \n In dust_hype, we have an open route which is exposed from middle which leads to the sniper's nest, with a vent opening from stairwell to access it. \n In dust_ae, we have instead a regular sniping spot for terorists which directly allows terrorists to peek middle like before, the difference being is that the room has a direct entrance to the room, and an extra small window to check the area before engaging. \n I believe the best solution would be to mix these changes together, as having these two routes being a risk of getting picked by CT snipers, it requires a lot of team effort to make a push (which isn't the case in matchmaking). I believe adding a slightly enclosed route with a window and wallbangable boxes/planks to allow T's to push without instantly dying or wasting a smoke, also being able to get on the wall edge to get to Sniper's nest, and having a route to snipers nest to set up a simultaneous B Split or B flank would be a good way to see if it is balanced. \n -The Tunnels- \n Narrow Chokepoint, a popular suggestions would be to add a second tunnel leading to the direction of A site, however many people overlook that an intersection would be a much better approach, having the second route which terrorists can switch between if they take control of the A tunnel, they could use a second entrance to A site on the left wall of bombsite A, having terrorists a better chance of getting information and being able to clear out the site better. Widening the tunnel to allow 2 players to have some place to move would be good. Before entering A site on the second tunnel i suggested, and open roof that allows throwing smokes and grenades on the site will fix the issue of grenades being pretty useless. \n -Middle- \n Shortdust has a feature which is actually good for the maps balance, it being a truck in the center of the map. It is misplaced, but having a stack of boxes or other items in the center of the map carefully positioned would make the pit route viable, along with obscuring some vision from sniper nest. Blocking some vision from A doors by giving T's more then one area to choose from would further make middle a definitive \"middle\" of the map, and would serve as a very interesting and vital area of control for the map. \n -Bombsite A- \n I suggested in my tunnels part of adding a secondary route to the site to the left side of the main tunnel to stop the wall from being just another corner to check, allowing also to set up grenades instead of having to be much further back, delaying the attack by having to first throw then go to tunnels, or risk loosing by charging early and get picked off. First thing's first, decluttering to some degree (not fully) would be a good step. Some may notice there is an overpowered (to me at least) sniping angle which allows for CT's to peek a narrow gape between the tunnel wall and the boxes, which allows easy picks on T's inside tunnels, blocking this angle is a crucial first step to balance. Having the door area on the site cleaned from camping spots would be clear as it served no purpose but to annoy T's by shooting them in the back (like rafters on nuke) By making this area easier to check, i suggest either stripping most of the clutter in that area or just shifting the boxes on the right wall in front of a doors to prevent T's from getting shot in the back. Overall the right side of a site besides having a couple of weird sniping angles through the boxes, so patching them up should be good, is pretty okay in it's state. The left side's sniping plateau having no box in the back where CT's can take cover and snipe at the same time, should be either removed or simply have blocked off vision from most of the site, being so if T's are already clearing out the site it shouldn't be much of a problem. \n By removing most camping sniper spots and adding some more cover for the T's to push would balance the A site so that you would not have to check a thousand corners as you entered. \n -Bombsite B- \n This one is pretty straight forward, from the moment they step out into the non existent doors of the B site entrance, Terrorists are doomed from the massively long distances having hidey holes for AWP's. Closing up Alley is discussable as with the extra route to snipers nest for terrorists, it makes the site both easier to defend and easier to try and take. Having some walls which restrict vision from the back of Site (specifically left side, the side where the bomb zone is) along with removing the \"canals\" on the right, along with less corners to check and long distances will balance the map. \n Summary ( [summary]: "}
{"input_text": "Hey everybody! So, firstly, I'm kinda new to Reddit, and this is my first time posting, so go easy on me. \n I guess I'll start by describing myself, then I'll talk about what I'm looking for. \n I'm a gay 21 year old college student and future teacher. I'm 5'9\", about 135 lbs, and white (Jewish, but not practicing (don't tell my dad)). Interests would include TV (Game of Thrones, Shameless, all the shows I watch(ed) as a kid, Arrested Development, Mr. Show, 3rd Rock from the Sun, Red Dwarf, OITNB. There are tons of others, but let's save something for when we meet), museums, NYC, traveling (though I'm way too poor to do much), and hanging out with friends (420, of course). There's a lot more to me than I can write here, and since I don't really have much experience with these posts, I don't really know what to include. I do have a car, though, so a few miles out here or there isn't such a big deal. \n I'm looking for a guy around my age (my cutoff is usually around 25, but sometimes I'll branch out further), who is caring, compassionate, funny, and knows how to get a shy guy out of his shell. I'm not really into very tall guys, but short is totally fine (preferably not overweight). Sex is not the first thing on my mind (maybe a close second), and it's very important to me that we're emotionally connected before we physically connect (though, the amount of time that will take really depends on how we interact). I don't have anything against long-distance relationships, so if you're far away and want to send me a message feel free, just make sure to read deal-breaker #3, it's especially important in those situations. \n Okay, now time for the deal-breakers. I don't think any of these are particularly bad, but maybe you will: 1) I can be really shy around new people. If you're warm and friendly, it won't take me too long to open up, but I will probably start off pretty awkwardly. 2) I'm broke. I can devise some pretty romantic dates for free, just don't expect me to buy you dinner afterwards or anything. it's not that I'm cheap, I just can't afford it. 3) I can be pretty needy. I love a guy who can reassure me when I don't ask for it, and knows how to make me feel good about myself. Sometimes, though, I admit I can be too clingy, and I'll probably want to text you all the time. I can fall in love really easily sometimes. But, I'm also really generous with compliments, so if you're needy too, step right up! \n Well, that's basically it. If you made it this far down I think we've already bonded enough for you to ask me out :). Just send me a private message with some face pics, and a little bit about yourself (I may ask for more face pics, I like to know I'm not being catfished). [summary]: "}
{"input_text": "Bit late to the party, but I figured I'd throw in my two cents. I've managed gaming clubs, and worked in gaming stores before and  unfortunately have seen a few fail, a few key points I'd suggest: \n 1) As has been mentioned, get the permits for food and drink, organise pizza night's stuff like that, when people want food or drink, they leave to get it, with no guarantees they come back after that. It's also a really decent money maker and can really help in the long run. \n 2) This is probably the biggest point to be made, set your precedences early, DnD players I've found as a whole aren't the best thing to cater to, as was mentioned they can do their stuff at home, you need to offer something to bring them in, but, and this is a big but, you need to make some cash of them. We did this by offering campaigns and experienced DM's for a price per person, a drink was included in this price. This however needs to be done from the very beginning, people need to know that they have to pay for the privilege, this was a mistake that I've seen made and pissed off a portion of the customer base. This also applies to any comps, drafts or tournaments you start up, standard price each time and people will learn, just like children. \n 3) Diversity in stock can be a pain and a godsend, I'm a tabletop gamer at heart but have roleplayed and cardgamed as well. What I  can say is MTG cards are a must, some of those guys will drop thousands, and I mean thousands chasing certain cards, if you can find someone who knows the game, learn which cards are worth money, open a box of them to find the rare expensive ones, this also gives brand new cards to stock up second hand folders, with every release most of the time we made money by doing this. Table top games can be a little different, this was my main area, but within this community there is still the divide of artists vs. Gamers. Artists want nice looking, fancy models with ranges of painting and sculpting items, I find this to be the minority, but if they find something they want will pay for it, gamers however don't care to much for modelling or painting, and just want the models themselves, that and glue, and the rulebooks, these are the quantity. I can guarantee Games workshop will bring people in, and if you have some tables for them they will stay and play, but GW are pains to deal with, and the profit margins on their products are rather abysmal, but make up for it in the quantity just gotta get the name out there, prize support for local tournaments help. Another quick tip for table top gamers is the young/New player ones usually drop the most money, as it costs a lot to get into, veterans can be pains in the arse/scrooges with prices \n Hope this helps love to see LGS's get off the ground and get people interested in some of the hobbies I love. PM me if you wanna chat, I managed a store for a close friend who owned the gaming store that's still running these days and if I can't help I can always ask him. [summary]: "}
{"input_text": "hello fellow JP fans. Some of you may have recognised my name from around the posts and maybe a couple may have seen me mention a Jurassic Park/World Novel. Well, I've been a fan for as long as I can remember, live my life by the Golden motto \"Life finds a way\" and constantly apply in context quotes form the films. Since Jurassic World was ACTUALLY confirmed(not like it was in 2008) my mind has gotten back to thinking about my novel again. I am aware that Treverrow was working on a script for Jurassic World 2 but couldn't come up with much. Well, I plan to write my novel and send it in to them as a script idea. So you guys are probably asking; \"TELL US THE IDEA!\". Well here we go.\nAs we all know the plot for Jurassic World is that there is a fully functioning Jurassic park that has been active for a few years and the create a Dinosaur Hybrid because of an attendance drop, and then there's screaming and running.... Well, what if there was an attendance drop because Jurassic World finally set up the enterprise. It was mentioned in the book and seen at the Lunch scene in the first movie. There were plans for Jurassic Park to go Global, setting up parks all around the world and we saw a concept glimpse at Jurassic Park Europe on one of the slides. Jurassic World America has an attendance drop because Jurassic World Europe has become operational. and being a new park filled with new dinosaurs it obviously gets everybody's attention as a 'better park'. The book/movie takes place as en equal rather than a sequel which is set after the original story. An Equal is the same story but told from a different perspective. Jurassic Europe would have different species than Jurassic America so that there remains interest and reasons to see all the different parks. So I have composed the Dino roster Draft; \n-Archaeopteryx\n (Dedicated scene)\n-Balaur\n (Main Dinosaur Protagonist)\n-Baryonyx\n (Dedicated scene\n-Compsognathus?\n-Dimorphodon\n {Minor Cameo}\n-Europasaurus\n-Hypsilophodon\n-Iguanodon?\n-Metriacanthosaurus \n (Dedicated scene)\n-Parasaurolophus? \n (Dedicated scene)[Ver. Aqua&Lans]\n-Plateosaurus?\n-Pteranodon\n {Minor Cameo}\n-Scelidosaurus \n (Dedicated scene)\n-Stegosaurus\n (Dedicated scene)\n-Turiasaurus\n (Dedicated scene)\n-Tyrannosaurus\n-Velociraptor\n (Main Antagonist) \n This is the second version of the Roster and it is still welcome for change. As you probably noticed there are still some American species but they are fan favourites. What would be a Jurassic Park movie without Trex or raptors? (Dedicated scene) under the name means that I have a scene idea that focuses particularly on that Dinosaur, much like {Minor Cameo} means that it will be seen in the movie/book but won't be focused on. The Velociraptors will play a part similar to the ones in jurassic park, dangerous creatures that are untamed and kept away form Visitors, however instead of training them for the public they are being used to try and make the Balaur, a European species which was more muscly than most raptors and had 2 sickles on each foot rather than one. including this new raptor species Balaur also means that we can also finally have a feathered raptor, which I have figured out how to explain how some of Jurassic Europe's species have feathers and why InGen decided to give them feathers. When the park looses power and everything gets out, the Raptors(velociraptors), being bigger and more savage find the Balaur pack and have a brawl, forcing them into the Veloci pack. Later however The Balaur turn on the Velociraptors when they were need most. making for a Lost world style rat or fight, much like the much anticipated Trex vs Irex fight. The Balaur would come out as Dinosaur Protagonists because they were still quite intelligent but weren't as savage, and much like a lot of wild animals, learn not to bit the hand that feeds them. \n But I should probably get down to the nitty gritty stuff as to why I'm posting this. I need some help and suggestions form the community, especially if this thing will have an chance of actually becoming apart of the franchise. For starters I need characters. I already have one, which is heavily based off of an older version of myself. Much like Ian Malcolm, but instead of seeing life from the views of Chaos, he sees the world from the views of somebody who suffers suicidal depression, and wakes up every day knowing the reality of death and how sudden it can take the people you love. Who as a suicidally depressed person, you learn that the people you love mean more than anything to you. I do not yet have a name for this character but he is Australian, not Stereotypical Australian, just normal like myself but If you have any names for him they are very welcome. I need more and other characters though as well. Which at this point is the main thing I'm asking help for. The plot is that the park has been open to the public for 2 weeks but Misrani has gotten in a team of experts and special guests for a day with the general public not permuted entrance. The only public members allowed in the park are those who booked to stay a night in the Hotels to have the full, 2 day experience. We definitely need a strong female lead, who I thought could possibly be an older Lex Murphy, who after being one of the few witnessing the first Jurassic park, never wanted to return to Isla Nublar. She has become a reporter or article writer and was invited to write a report on the park. However there are rumours that Lex may be in Jurassic World, meaning that she couldn't be in this story because it takes place at the same time as Jurassic World. \n I am hoping that you guys could help me on this as it is a dream for me to be doing this and knowing how supportive this subreddit's community is I'm sure that I will get some support. Expect to see more about this in the future and I will also post concept ideas of the Dinosaurs as well.\nI know that Jurassic Park doesn't have the most scientifically accurate dinosaurs but Look at dilophasaurus, one of the most inaccurate but the movie is infamous for it and it became a fan favourite. So some dinosaurs won't be scientifically accurate, for example the Balaur will be about double the real size maybe even 2.5x and Scelidosaurus will be very different sculling low to the ground like an alligator. When I get a chance I will post the concept art for it, I think it's a very nice fit for the jurassic Park Universe. [summary]: "}
{"input_text": "I'm a big fan of Colbert. Now that he has had some time to settle in at the new show, I am beginning to ask myself a few things. \n I've been soul searching on why I feel just a bit disappointed by Colbert's Late Show. I think it's because it is a much more radical hybrid between the Report and the \"traditional\" Late Night format than the other recent newcomers (please, let's not make this a host-vs-host argument, that's not what I was thinking about). \n Big Network Late Night has been struggling to make that generational transition, even more so since extra-traditional TV is less and less relevant for viewers under 30. As we all know, with median viewership age in the 50s, Late Night has an advertising- and relevancy-problem. Clearly, Colbert's show shoots for that transition (and I think I remember network heads saying something about that in interviews). The way they go about it seems a little off to me. \n CBS or Colbert or both seem to feel that they need to retain the exact Colbert report audience by doing political and social commentary in a behind-the-desk style a la Colbert Report. In the same manner, there are a bunch of \"nerd culture\" (i.e. Lord of the Rings and Star Wars) sketches, as well as segments that employ cultural references that are unlikely to register fully with 30+ aged viewers (\"Hungry for Power games\"). Clearly, all these must be directed at the original Report viewership. \n Two sides to this: For me, as someone who is going on 40 (a couple of years and I'll finally be allowed to have my midlife crisis! Yes!), I sometimes feel a bit bored by the \"Young Adult / nerd culture\" focus. I get it, it's partly an age thing, but it's not like I was exclusively into Star Wars etc. when I was in my 20s. Is it really that big a deal, does a 20 year old really believe that the Late Show \"gets\" him/her? Would this even make him/her more likely to TIVO / turn on the TV to watch the show? Doesn't it come across as a bit pandering? Secondly, is this worth leaving out the 40+ crowd or anyone who is not into these subcultures? TV can be bland if we always cater to the lowest common denominator, but would this really be the case here if they were to dial this back? \n Regarding the behind-the-desk political commentary: this feels the most \"jarring\" because the writing and performance sometimes feels somtimes ham-fisted, mostly because it's following the news-cast teleprompter style, just like we enjoyed it on the Report. But because it's Late Night, it has been dialled back in its agressiveness. It's not as hard hitting as before, but \"preachy\" enough to \"feel\" odd in the Late Night context. One moment he (rightfully) mocks Trump, the next moment he does a segment like \"Trump phone\", which seems more \"traditional\", in that it uses politics as a theme, not as an issue. Furthermore, the way it is performed makes it seem over-rehearsed and stiff at times, at least for me. \n The thing is, I would have loved to see him lose his \"shtick\" more than I would have liked the Late Show format changed. I believe that Stephen is clever, intellectually deep and varied, and from all we know about his public persona, a great person with outstanding ethics and morals. That's the most important thing to bring to Late Night. A likeable person that you feel good about inviting him/her into your living room every weeknight. Carson was that way. Stephen has the potential to surpass Carson, in my opinion, because of his persona. All he needs is to come across less rehearsed and more relaxed. Something I hope that time will help with. \n For me, that's all that \"Network Late Night\" needs. I am a simple man that way. It's been about light-hearted fun, a few jokes, a nice conversation, maybe a sketch, and from time to time a remote segment. And sometimes, a conversation would be serious and insightful. Network Late Night can make fun of poltiical and social events, but I am not sure it is a good fit for the The Daily Show / Colbert Report brand of comedy-journalism. \n And I would argue that Late Night doesn't need it and that if TV survives, younger viewers will tune in because of Colbert, not because of any Colbert Report segments they try to adapt. I remember Letterman doing the first show after 9/11, or Craig Ferguson talking earnestly, seriously about addiction (was it in the Charlie Sheen days or after MJs death? I don't remember the occassion). These were great moments, sometimes teachable moments. \n I acknowledge it is quite a strange statement to say that late night should be less like the vastly successful cable late night brand that Jon Stewart and Colbert really brought to the next level, but I never watched a Daily Show at night, only online the next day, and I never felt that it works as an uncomplicated \"bookend\" to a stressful day like Network Late Night is supposed to be in my eyes.  I never like to go to bed angry. But then again, the question is very much whether creating a format for scheduled programming is even a sensible thing to do anymore in the age of VOD. \n Anyway, that's my two cents. Would love to hear a whole bunch of different opinions. \n To end with something less complainy: In my eyes truly fantastic is the selection and variety of guests, and the Late Show did well in emphasizing this strategy in the press before the premiere. Polticians and artists have always been late night staples, but also having other people like CEOs on (other than just the occassional Bill Gates) is mixing things up and allows for a broader depiction of \"society\", if you get my drift. \n WHOA, wall of text.

{"input_text": "I see what you mean. However, I find that playing without them forces players to have to be more efficient on gathering power tokens, mustering and how to move units/armies. You also have to be careful as to what house cards to use. We've only done one game without the tides of battle. I won it with Tyrell in a 5 player game. Though I had gotten very lucky. Because I managed to get King's Landing due to a mistake from Baratheon. Then I managed to reconquer it after when muster cards were up. I'd say both Baratheon and Stark had started better than me as they both had more land and power tokens. But neither really gathered armies mainly power tokens, meanwhile I did. While Lannister and Greyjoy were exterminating each other (really they had barely any units left and nobody was joining in on their fight). I don't know, guess we'll have to keep testing a few games just to see. \n But I guess the cards do add a little randomness factor. Which can be more \"realistic\"?

{"input_text": "Alright well as you can see this is a dummy account and as my ex-does reddit and I am not sure if she is in here. \n So I moved in with my ex after dating her for six months, where we saw good times, bad times, really large difficulties, and places I have not been in a long time, and one that I have never been to before.  We recently broke up in a most difficult way, and because of all of it I really am having trouble typing but I will do my best...  I do want to say that I know that I am not without fault, and that I am not pointing fingers but instead I am really having trouble after the break up and thus use the anonymity of the internet and look for  constructive/objective  feedback. \n Alright so as with many relationships there are times for arguments and fights, but it seems that over the months it seems that things began to get worse during times of sobriety and intoxication (intoxication contributing to the more negative and aggressive fights).  When we would argue and fight I would either try and talk to her about what happened and how we could avoid or grow from the situation; I realize that not everything needs to be discussed I felt that when they were consistent rough spots that they should be worked on by both people.  You may not be able to come to a fix each but commutating together you can see where each is coming from (agree or not) and either solve the issue or just find common ground and move forward. \n There were times that this happened and others that it only met with hostility, but each time I tried - I wanted to know why she was angry and what I could do to better for me, her, and us.  We would go though similar cycles generally where - something would be said/done, misinterpreted and reacted to, then a argument/fight would ensue, we would get to a point to either try and talk about it or just let it go, and then move on...  after moving on something very similar or a tangent would happen and the cycle would begin again.  Sometimes the cycle would have days or weeks in between but it seems that more recently the cycle resets much quicker and we would have multiple arguments a week. \n I had tried to talk to her about this cycle and the fact that I was afraid that this was really hurting our relationship and that we both needed to work on the problems that we were facing.  The normal response that I would get would be something like \"don't fucking talk to me about this, keep it to your self.  If you talk to me about this it will only make me feel this way and cause problems in our relationship.\"  I would feel bad about trying to talk to her about this and felt that if she is telling me that she wants to work on things she and I trusted that montra. \n I am currently in school and working two jobs and she works as well.  A week before the breakup  we had done a small trip where I was unable to do homework in preparation for the upcoming week because I was focusing on having fun and being out with her on our trip.  This created a great amount of stress for me and so on the way home I tried to get as much as I could done, but was not enough to get me caught up or to alleviate my stress for getting homework done, and the excitement and anxiety I had about helping to make her birthday special. \n The day of her birthday I did minimal homework and then ran some errands in that morning before I went to work to get ready for the night to come.  I had tried to get to her job to surprise her with a balloon and flower but had a bit of a mishap and destroyed the flower and balloon after hitting a pot hole on my bicycle.  I got to work and expressed how excited I was to spend the night with someone that I love so much (never saying anything about being nervous about not doing the right things for her birthday, or the fact that I was a bit nervous about her drinking - I wanted to celebrate with her and really just wanted to have fun and wanted to put all of it aside). \n When she got home she seemed to be extremely stressed and drained, but I attributed it to her long day of work on her birthday.  She saw the three cakes that I baked and decorated for her, which she seemed to be highly disappointed in as (her words) \"I had that type cake just the other day  :| .\"  She went to lay down and I followed and just was with her - rubbed her back and snuggled with her trying to help her to relax. \n I remember waking up and realizing that she wasn't in the bed with me, but I heard her upstairs talking to her friend about how upset she was that we hadn't gone to dinner and how this birthday was her worst birthday.  I tried not to eves drop too much but I from what I did overhear she was just really unhappy with all of it.  She came down a little while later and was visibly pissed, and did not say anything.  I waited to talk to her and see what I could do because I was afraid that if I tried to talk to her about it she would be mad and fight with me, but she didn't say anything so after a little bit I asked her and she told me that she was so upset that I fell asleep and that it was too late to go to dinner.  It was about two hours till the place we were going to go closed and I told her that it wasn't too late and asked why she didn't wake me up.  This led to an argument and a bit of a fight which finally settled to a simmer and we started to talk. \n I found out shortly after this that she was also unhappy that she made plans with her friends to go out.  Finding this out also lead to a bit of a disagreement as when she told me she didn't seem like she wanted me to go, saying stuff like \"my friend will be here to pick me up in twenty\" and \"my friend is asking what time I am meeting her.\"  I said something like \"so then I'll stay home then?\"  and she responded with something like \"I just assumed that you would stay home and do homework.\" Yes I realize that my response was a bit passive but I felt hurt that I took the next two nights and the following Saturday off from doing homework so that I would be able to spend it only with her.  This led into another argument as I tried to explain that all I wanted to do was spend time with her on her birthday, doing what she wanted - which is what she did with me on my birthday. \n We argued about this and then finally after a while we got ready and  went to meet her friends at a bar and had a couple of drinks.  We switched bars and finished the night at one that was close by.  At the end of the night I was really happy and had had a good time, even pushing through my anxiety and just focusing on wanting to be out with her we headed to the car to head home.  We were walking to the car and she asked me if she was going to get lucky to which I responded \"maybe\" as a joke.  Why the hell would I not want to have sex with my partner, I was only joking (albeit a bad joke - I have never turned down sex with her).  She got really pissed at my joke and started to yell at me about it, and I attempted to explain that I was only joking but instead I just felt like shit that I had tried to joke. \n We got closer to the car and I see down the street that there was a cop, because she was still yelling I asked her to be a little quiet. She yelled at me and told me that I \"never let her have fun, and all I do is try to tell her what to do,\" while I got the car ready and finally stops yelling as I get into the car.  Once in the car she tells me that I am an ass and yells a little bit more, and I snap I yell at her telling her that she needs to stop being so pissed off its her fucking birthday, and that I have done nothing today other than to try and do things to celebrate with her, and that I love her and she has to stop yelling at me for this shit.  She gets even more pissed and tried to get out of the car.  I see that the cop is still close by and grab her to pull her back into the car (bit of a struggle, but weren't noticed by the cop), and once she was back in the car she punches me in the face getting me in the right eye.  I grab the steering wheel and tell her that we are through to which she replies \"thats right we are fucking done.\" \n I drive us to the house  while dealing with her telling me how horrible I am and how I fucked up the day, we get home and the insults continue and continue.  I get ready for bed as I have to be at my new job in the morning and had no where to go and just wait for her to lay down - when she drinks once she calms down she normally passes out.  Even while she is telling me that I am horrible I try really hard to calm her down and smooth things over, and eventually she stops insulting me.  When she gets into bed I am not talking and that is when she starts to insult me again...  I ask her to stop because I didn't deserve this and didn't do anything, she has no reason to be so angry.  She kept pushing and pushing and I finally snapped (never in my entire life have I ever snapped - I have hurt myself by punching myself and cutting, something that I had started to do again shortly after I moved in with her, but  NEVER  have I snapped).  I threw off the blanket and grabbed her and choked her - I can't believe that I did that seriously never have I done anything like that and it scared the crap out of me, just as much if not more than her - I immediately stopped after I realized what I was doing and saw her face, I got up and left the room. \n I came back and tried to explain and apologize (there is no excuse but I was freaked out).  She told me to get out and then told me to get out and not take anything, I was confused and had no where to go and finally went upstairs with a knife.  I haven't been in a situation where I have wanted to hurt myself permanently in over a decade.  I tried to cut but stopped and called the suicide prevention hotline, but then flashed back to what I had done and thought that they would call the police and hung up.  Shaking I called my friend and talked with them for three hours and finally put the knife down and passed out. \n The following day I rented a truck and moved immediately.  And I haven't had contact with her since...  I have talked to my friends about this and they are not happy with what I did (neither am I and I am actually having a hard time not continually beating myself up in my head) but they know that its not who I am and I have never done anything like this.  They have tried to talk to me about the fact that I haven't seemed happy in a while and that as I knew this was building and beginning to bubble over.  I have tried to talk to her about this and other things, I have tried to work through difficulties together and to break the cycle that had become a horrible strain and negative impact on us. \n I have had trouble accepting the end of these ideas...   and not feeling that there would be something more that I could have done to help our relationship.  I love this woman and never have I felt that I have been at home with someone, but I have never been to this point with anyone and it really scared me.  Being torn apart because of what happened and breaking up is one of the hardest things that I have ever done.  I know its part of the 7 stages of grief but god i feel like shit.  I just wanted things to work out with us, and have been going back and forth with the \"what else could I have done\" and then \"if i loved her as much as I do then why couldn't i make her happy, or why couldn't I have been more patient and ignored her unhappiness and negativity,\" etc etc. \n I am going back to therapy and seeking help but I would like to know if anyone out there that has been in a similar situation would care to share words of wisdom.  I feel very lost and in a thick fog and need some help to get beyond it.  Sigh I am so tired, and feel very lonely, so I must finish not necessary abruptly but I need sleep.  I will be able to respond tomorrow - I feel horrible about what I did and fear that I will be flooded with messages telling me that I am a horrible person and a pile of shit, but I am hoping very strongly that someone here will be objective and caring enough to help me with my jumbled thoughts and feelings. \n Thank you for reading.

Before this, we both worked crappy retail jobs making $8 an hour, but with both our wages, it even out to right around $1100 a month. We were renting, so that took about half our income. In the inheritance, he got roughly $60,000, and he gained a house that is fully paid off, so we don't have to pay rent; however, since we've become married, our bills have doubled. We now also pay for insurance and our Mobile phones...and the satellite and internet that he wanted. That's not the problem, because these are things I use as well. The problem is here, is that 90% of that money went into buying him a new truck(which he needed) and to fix up the house. \n Here is where the problem begins. After all the work we put in, the money he has is now down to about 3 grand. There is still a CD that he left that has around $20,000 dollars in it, but he can't get into that anyway. My main issue is that, I want to go back to school, I've filled out the paper work and I'm waiting to hear back from the school.

He can still play his games on the second computer we have. \n I came home from working my soul crushing job, that I have so we can keep bills paid, and walk in to him and his friend admiring a new computer. He didn't ask if he could get one, he didn't tell me he was going to get one. There was next one in my house when I got home. The thing that pushes me over the edge and this, is I've been asking him for weeks to get a job. Last week, I specifically told him, \"please get a job before you spend a grand on a computer.\" He didn't even bother to respond to me. I've tried bringing it up, but I feel like he feels he's allowed to because now we (meaning ME) don't have to pay rent anymore because of the money he inherited, that is now almost gone. How should I handle this situation? \n I'm also going to apologize now for any grammar, spelling, or formatting errors, I'm typing this on my phone. That's right, I can't even use his new computer.

{"input_text": "I really don't think /gaming or Reddit will remember me posting my professor's syllabus a few weeks ago that made it to the front page.  But that doesn't really matter to me, I'm not making this post for Karma, which was the case when I posted his syllabus the first time.  I'm making this post as my way to honor my professor that inspired many of my fellow classmates and I, even though we only had him for a few short weeks.  When someone passes away people tend to over embellish how much that individual impacted their lives and exaggerate \"what a great person they were\".  This is one of the rare instances where the man truly lives up to his postmortem accolades. \n From the first day of class I could tell this class was going to be nothing like any class at my university.  His vivacious energy to teach a class of 80 non-science majors on day one could only be matched by his neon blue pants.  After he introduced himself and professed his love on brightly colored pants, he passed out the syllabi to each student.  This was my third class of the day, and being a second semester junior, I had become accustomed to the monotony of going over each class\u2019s syllabus.  As I began flipping through the pages of what I expected to be the usual due dates, honor code, schedule, class requirements, etc\u2026 the word Steam caught my eye.  The syllabus stated that Steam software would be required for the course.  I thought to myself, \u201cthis must be some science related program that happens to have the same name as the gaming application.\u201d  To my delight I quickly found out that I was wrong and in fact the Steam software in the syllabus and the gaming application were one in the same.  The dull spell of syllabus week had been broken; my eyes quickly scanned the next page of the syllabus to see what games we would be required to play.  The words Portal 2 and Half-Life 2 leapt off the page at me.  My thoughts started racing, \u201ccould this be true?  Is my professor going to require that my class play arguably the greatest computer games of all time?\u201d  Sure enough he explained that he was a dedicated gamer himself, playing hundreds of hours of Borderlands 2, and the first assignment was to add him as a friend on Steam. \n He then divulged into his lecture on the power of 10.  He already had my utmost attention, and his lecture surpassed my already high expectations.  With each of his lectures he instantly captured the full attention of a class of 80 students that were required to take a science course as a perquisite for graduation.  He, being a high level research chemistry professor with an impressive resume, was able to break down science to a level that allowed my class and I to understand.  His examples and teaching methods on the power of 10 had the entire class captivated.  I truly wish I would have had gotten an entire semester of his class but I am grateful I am grateful I was lucky enough to have him for even a few short weeks.  I was even lucky enough to have a short Steam Chat conversation with him about Company of Heroes. \n On the second day of class I was bragging to a few of my classmates how I got to the front page of Reddit posting his syllabus.  I was wondering to myself if my professor was a Redditor himself and saw my post.  He began class very seriously saying he had an announcement for the class.  He started with the statement, \u201cWhoever put my syllabus on some obscure website\u2026\u201d My heart began pounding so heavily in my chest I thought for sure he was going to be able to hear it.  Then a sigh of relief came over me when he finished the sentence with, \u201c\u2026I just want to say thank you.  I don\u2019t want to know who you are right now but you have opened so many doors for me.\u201d  He began to tell us how the developers and individuals that worked for Universe Sandbox, and Valve got in contact with him.  If this post somehow gets some recognition on Reddit and whoever you are that contacted him, I just want to personally thank you.  I have never seen a professor so excited in my life.  You helped make the last few weeks of his life a little bit happier. \n I was going to tell him on the last day of class that I posted his syllabus, but unfortunately I will never get the chance to.  On the day of his death I sent him an email about how Portal 2 was 75% off, so he could tell the class.  Of course I figured he would have already known because he was the most active of all my Steam friends. \n All I can say is thank you to my professor for sparking an interest in science for my classmates and I.  I will never have the privilege of having a professor quite like you were.  RIP [summary]: "}

{"input_text": "I've posted this before, but I'll put it here again, this time with some more up-to-date info. \n I'm 16, and I've always been really into 60's and 70's blues rock and hard rock. My first experience with records was when I was in 4th grade. I had begun to play the trombone in the school band, so my grandpa gave me these two old trombone jazz records, The Jai & Kay Trombone Octet's  Jay & Kay + 6  and  Dave Brubeck and Jai & Kay at Newport  on the old red and black Columbia \"Six-eye\" label. I didnt have a turntable, so they hung out in the cabinet under my TV. Skip forward a couple of years when I was at my Grandpa's house a few years ago and he pulls this big, metal footlocker out of his basement and sticks it in his den. Upon further inspection, I discovered that it was his collection of jazz records from when he was a kid in the 50's. Upon also learning that he had a turntable to play them on, I decided to bring my two records with me next time I came over. So that time comes and I bring the records and he starts playing one of them. I was fascinated by the fact that you could see the music while it was being played, but even more by the fact that so much sound could be held in a groove on a piece of plastic. I decided to maybe buy a record or two to hang on my wall, so I did a little research and decided that I wanted a copy of Boston's first album to hang up. Before I was able to do this, however, my birthday came around and my grandpa bought me a turntable. I was thrilled. I played my two albums over and over and over again until I knew every note on them (which didn't take that long since I had them in constant rotation every hour and ten minutes or so). Then one day, I was in the basement doing laundry and I stumbled upon my mom's old Billy Joel records. I ran upstairs and listened to them and decided that I needed more! On Thanksgiving I stumbled upon her box of 45s, of which my favorite was \"Another Brick in the Wall, Part II\". I went to a record show, where I made my first two record purchases, an (unbeknownst to me at the time) first pressing of The Rolling Stones'  Some Girls  (with the original inner sleeve) and a copy of the Quadrophenia soundtrack. At some point, my grandma found her old collection of about 200 45s which she gave me. My favorite out of those was Sam Cooke's \"Chain Gang\". Then my other grandma gave me her old, mostly classical, but with some other albums. My favorite is a live Carlos Montoya album. From there, one thing led to another and now have over 270 albums and 300 45s. For my birthday, I upgraded my setup to include seperate components instead of my all-in-one unit (yes my old system was a Crosley, please forgive my sins. My new system  is  still an entry-level setup, but hey, it was a gift.)  The highlights of my collection include my mono first pressing of  Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band  with the Fool's psychedelic inner sleeve and cut-out sheet, a copy of  Are You Experienced  on the original tri-color label, my mint British first pressing of Pink Floyd's  Relics , and my single of \"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\".

{"input_text": "First off long post so I apologize for the massive wall of text...not sure if I should post it to dating advice or bdsm community so I chose here. All thoughts would be appreciated. I should also state I had no problems with anything that occurred during this entire post and still have no problems with any events. \n I have had this man I am dating for the past 2 and a half months. We have indulged in some light kink play and I have enjoyed it all as I figured we were just spicing up our sex life. \n A few weeks ago he bought fuzzy red handcuffs after a sex session in which he tied me up to the bed with his work ties and blindfolded me with his work ties (which was originally my idea for us to try because I wanted to jazz things up). \n He left town for a little bit and while he was gone I sent him a dirty text message while he was with a family just to tease him. He responded that he liked my \"sassiness because I know when to use it\" but at the same time I can be \"submissive and obedient\" and he likes both. \n When he came back we were making out on his couch and this is when the play started to change a little. He took his hand and put it around my neck applying pressure and told me that if I became uncomfortable or if it wasn't ok to let him know and he would stop, I told him he was fine and we kept kissing while he applied this forceful pressure to my neck. We stopped kissing and went back to watching tv when I accidentally spilled a little of my beer. I went to clean it up and he bit me on my right hip. I asked him if he had just bit me and he said if I didn't make a mess he wouldn't have had to punish me. \n Fast forward to the bedroom and we are having sex when he turns me around and threads my hands through his bed posts. He handcuffs me and is pulling my hair back and says, \"Now you can't move and are my fucking slave, I would bite you all over if you didn't bruise so easily so you would know every time you look at them whose property you were.\" I told him he could bite my back and he did, not a love bite but really hard (yes, I liked it just was surprised at how hard he did it). I told him ahhhh you really did bite me, bite me and he said, \"yes, you gave me permission,\" I asked him (kind of jokingly), \"Am I supposed to call you master now or something?\" He said no. \n So then he loosens the handcuffs after a little more play, makes me give him a loose rubber band I had at the side of his bed and he uses it around his cock to keep him hard longer. (He says this when I ask him if my hair was in the way) \n He gets off the bed and goes and gets two ties and tells me, \"I am going to tie your legs to the bed posts so you can't move at all. You can keep your hands above your head or I can handcuff them there for you if you touch me.\" \n So he ties me spread eagle and I accidentally touch him, he tells me he warned me and takes another tie ropes it through the bed then attaches me to that tie with the handcuffs. (I am 5'3 so it might have been because I was too short to be actually handcuffed). He tells me if I get uncomfortable or freak out let him know and he can untie the top tie at any time. I ask him what are we supposed to have a safe word like banana or something and he kind of cracks a grin. \n We finish up and he unties me and tells me to flip over. He then proceeds to give me a back rub (because I had asked for one the night before) and then we both fall asleep. \n Flash forward few days later, I didn't realize actually how \"rough\" he was being. My throat has been very sore, my lower abs and vagina have been very tender and hurt a little, plus my right wrist has a little bruising on it from being tied up. \n This is the third time we have played at him taking control. I am starting to wonder if he is into BDSM which is fine, I enjoy being a little submissive in the bedroom. He has also been fooling around with my backdoor a little bit but hasn't gone all the way with that. \n He has taken part in threesomes with 2 guys 1 girl in the past but says he doesn't anymore. When I asked him what he likes sexually and what his fantasies are he said he is up for anything that he has no limits. \n We also have had outdoors sex and last time we were at a bar he wanted to finger me but have me stay quiet. \n I am really sure what I should do now. A couple who are friends with me and are into bdsm says he sounds like he is a seasoned dom and has done this stuff before. \n I personally want to ask him but I am unsure exactly how to do it. My gut feeling is to just keep riding this train and see if he brings it up? \n Side note: He also said he just wants us to keep dating to which I replied was fine, I said dating is nice because we get to know if we even like each other, he said yes because usually when labels are applied he gets bored 3 months in and when his friends ask why he just says he doesn't know. Maybe it's inconsequential but is it possibly he gets bored because he doesn't want vanilla sex and they do? It might not have anything to do with it, it might just figured I would give all the info.

{"input_text": "There are two problems that arise with this. The [one hooplah addressed in that posting]( and the other what Urthwhyte said here. \n The idea of a beginner wardrobe guide is the type of thing that is causing MFA a bit of trouble, as a large subset ends up wearing the same thing and not learning on how to think about their clothes. This is perfectly fine for certain things (basic workwear guides, etc.; things that you don't want to necessarily stand out but rather look good but in the element), but not for many others. \n The current basic/beginners wardrobe guide is, in reality, a product of FFA first trying to get its footing a while back. But we're working on establishing a much more versatile, and in the end hopefully useful forum (a slow, and in many ways head-bangingly painful process). The idea is to put the tools together which hopefully cultivate the community to, as a whole, be able to piece together their own wardrobes based on aesthetic leanings. But with a sense of style and comprehension of what actually works and doesn't, not just what people want to wear. \n In that sense, developing a series of individually cultivated starter wardrobe guides does more harm than good, replacing education with rote mirroring. It's not that it is a bad idea, which it isn't, but in the end we're not sure it will do anything but make FFA less helpful in the long run.

{"input_text": "Hello All, \n I know there is a Maschine subreddit, but it doesn't see the same amount of discussion and I feel this subreddit would be a good fit for this from a non-biased standpoint. \n Quick about me: Been an electronic music fan all of my life, changing genres often. Had my first mixer when I was probably 15 (Numark CD-mix 1, and (1) Numark Direct Drive TT). Those faded out of my interests after a couple years, and fast forward to last year I began mixing on DJM850/(2) CDJ850/Traktor set up. I have been having a lot of fun with mixing but my real interest is in Production. I have been pushing myself into that realm and taking a lot of tutorial type classes (everything from Groove 3 to random youtube videos). I am primarily into Techno/Electro/Minimal Techno and occasionally lend an ear to some of the more experimental/non traditional forms of techno. I find my production goal to be a blend of the first 3. \n For this reason, I never saw myself as a pad person, and prior to becoming a bit more acquainted with production assumed it would only serve hip hop producers well. Fast forward to a ton of research and videos, and I found myself really liking the Maschine. I also have been experimenting with different mixing styles and find myself wanting to move to the creative set ups used by Hawtin, Liebing, Dubfire and the like, where they incorporate Maschine into live sets. \n At this point I am convinced I want a maschine. I went to guitar center to 'try' it, and unfortunately they did not have the studio, but they did have the MK2. I instantly feel in love and within 10 minutes of poking at it felt I had accomplished a better sound than I do inside the DAW. It's input style just seemed to drag me into creative curisity, and I could have stayed all night. \n My only issue is, I am fairly set on the studio after watching a lot of demonstrations and reading on them. However, it seems the general attitude on communities like this is that it simply isn't worth the price tag over an MK2. It seems to me that it is, and I like alot of what the studio offers, but I am willing to hear opinions. The only downside is, the studio is much larger, which makes its practicality for live sets much less appealing. However, I do not really intend on 'gig-ing,' so this wouldn't be an actual concern. Discussing it with others I came to the conclusion that if I ever decided I did want to pursue that path and the Maschine became an essential part of my live set, I could always purchase a used MK1 for that purpose, since by the time my opinion would change (which isn't planned) they would be fairly cheap. \n Edit: I should add that I am not considering the Maschine for complete track production, I also utilize Logic X. I have a 'temporary copy' of ableton live, that I am using to determine if it is worth the plunge to utilize it for send/return effects while mixing, but will probably end up deciding to purchase for the usage of Maschine during dj sets. So as of now consider my production Logic X/Maschine, and in the near future I will have access to Logic X/Maschine/Ableton Live. [summary]: "}

{"input_text": "A little backstory: Today my AKM (Base gun Echo1 Redstar AKM) that I have put ~70k rounds through finally stripped a gear during a game today. I bought it second hand on craigslist for 85$ along with a 11.1 lipo and charger, and it has served me faithfully for 1.5 years. It went from looking like [This]( to [This]( in that time period and has been modified/taken apart many times; over time potmetal parts have broken and pins in body have gotten a little loose. While I plan to fix gearbox because I know how to work on this particular gun well by now, I feel like it is time to change it up and use a different platform. I have never really loved AKs, It has just preformed very well for the price and even though I have money to spend I am quite frugal. \n I have always loved bullpups but for one reason or another every one that has came out hasn't fit the bill for me really to my knowledge. Ergonomics aren't really a problem for me because I am used to my AK. In terms of gun preference, I don't really care. I like all the common bullpup guns, l85, aug etc etc etc but would not want a UAR. I also like to use midcaps and a lot of the bullpups that use stanag mags don't work with most m4 midcaps it seems. I am more worried about ease of disassemble and compatibility with aftermarket parts, as long with a inner barrel length of no more than 455mm, as I want to reuse my prommy r hopped barrel that I use in my AKM. In my experience the AKM is not super fast to dissemble compared to some other guns and is a little annoying at times. \n Another reason I'm looking for a different platform is because nowadays many times I run a modded  CYMA g18 AEP  like my AKM does, it allows me to play much more aggressively and has about 150 foot effective range with 220 fps, all for 220$ including my 14 mags I run with it. I also really like reloading and with 28 round mags @ 22 rps.... :P Many bullpups don't weigh 9lb loaded like an ak does and are easier to use when going around corners and in cqb, but want a full sized rifle/gearbox for those bigger CTF field games where flanking is very difficult.

At most, from Draft I would get a little over 5 minutes wait. But it was worth it because I would get the chance of playing the role I got with a lot less toxicity. \n From Team Builder I'm waiting longer than 30 minutes for a role that I'm sure to get but eventually the wait gets to me, I leave to play Blind Pick.

{"input_text": "I have been seeing a delightful fellow for the past four months. It's not difficult for me to get dates, but most guys rarely make it past the first 2-4. When I get hung up on someone, I get very hung up indeed. In the past, this has caused me to either ignore potential problems that I saw coming a mile away, or to compromise heavily on my end for the sake of the other person's happiness\u2014often with nothing in return. \n I'm not going to lie; I want to settle down with someone. Given that, I've been trying steadily over the past two years to more honestly evaluate people and their long-term potential. My specified love interest is not perfect, but he is confident, logical, compassionate, and shares with me a great affinity for art as a lifelong pursuit. There are far more positives for me to list than negatives. After I'd known him a month, he told me that he loved me. This scared me a little, but it also intrigued me. He said it so calmly, and to the best I could tell, he was sincere. Over the past couple months, I've allowed myself to openly fall for him. I let my guard down, and that wasn't easy for me. I told him I loved him also, I introduced him to my family, I showed him the town where I'm from... I began sharing my hopes and dreams to him. Yesterday, I was really excited. I had checked my credit and found that I suddenly qualified for far better financing terms than I did a year ago. I don't particularly want to rent, as I think buying would be a far investment. I had been doing some research and found a little house in the country that I was excited about, and I sent him over a link, asking his honest opinion. Since I tend to get swept up in possibilities, I wanted to know if I was being unrealistic in my appreciation for what the house had to offer. \n That's where the conversation took a weird turn. He mentioned that I was too young to have my heart set on a house in the country, that I should wait until I was much older before I made a move like that. (Quick background info: I already live out in the boondocks with my parents, where we've lived for over a decade. He lives in a townhouse in a nearby city, right in the middle of downtown.) He absolutely had a point, and I was ready to consider it. After all, the home was very small. What happened when I was ready to upgrade? It would be difficult to sell or rent in such a remote area. But when it came down to it, I told him I just couldn't see myself living in a city long-term. He quickly answered that he couldn't see himself living anywhere -but- the city long-term. At this point, I've got a huge lump in my throat. Bare minimum, I want to live in a house with a yard and a workshop in a neighborhood I'm not afraid to walk around alone outside at night. I am  vastly  more comfortable in the country than  I am in a busy downtown area. I ask him if this is a deal-breaker for him. He says, \"No\", but then mentions that I have a point. We continue to hash it out. \n At the end of the conversation, we determine that it would be selfish for either one of us to ask the other one to give up what they wanted. The most mature thing to do was to call it quits before we got in any deeper. The thing is, though, I was already falling much deeper than I meant to. I regret even bringing the topic up, and the idea of not dating this guy anymore is eating a pit into my stomach. I've spent the whole day trying to hide tears behind my desk at work. Even though we mutually agreed that it was the right thing to do, I feel absolutely wretched. Even though he told me that he doesn't want to move out of the busiest part of the city for 10 years, even though he seems pretty committed to living in a townhouse or a downtown loft with no yard, I'm still mentally trying to find a compromise with him. I even picked out a couple houses (purely as examples) to show him the area I had in mind. I haven't told him any of that, because I'm afraid I'll sound like a possessive nutter-butter. \n Up until this point, this has been the most communicative, least-possessive/codependent relationship I've ever been in. To say the least, I'm reluctant to see it go. I even wrote this long-ass letter a couple hours ago attempting to describe the nature of a compromise with him, which is CRAZY, because I've known this guy four months. But if in a hypothetical future situation, he'd be willing to meet me even 3/4 of the way, that'd be more than anyone else has ever done for me. I want us both to be happy. I think I could do 2 minutes outside of downtown with a yard with the right person, but I have no way to know this soon if that'd be him. I don't want to compromise my own well-being, but I also don't want to lose a good thing. I've also found it pretty much impossible to locate an intelligent, artsy guy who was enthusiastic about living in the country\u2014to the point that I'm not even sure such a guy exists. I don't know whether to bring up any of this with him or to just let it go. Things were going so well! Any insight at all would be appreciated. [summary]: "}

{"input_text": "I remember opening a ticket with Riot when Team Builder was still going on and I had suggested a solution for long wait times that could possibly make players happy at the same time. The idea obviously went nowhere, but after seeing all of these problems I figured I could bring it up again. \n Give the players an incentive! \n My suggestion is simple:  Have an icon pop up saying what roles are currently in demand at the moment, and give the players who fill those roles an IP boost. \n To use the metaphor from the recent Riot discussion video. Think of the roles as buckets, one for top, mid, jung, bot, and support. Once someone queues, they are a marble in the bucket(role) they chose. Once there is a marble (player) in each bucket that meet the requirements, we remove those players, and send them into champ select. The argument was basically that mid or top would be overflowing, while support would be practically empty. So what if support was in a little demand, we could have a starting point for bonus IP being at, let's say 'x 1.25', and maybe a maximum of 'x 2.00'. The more overflowing the other roles, the higher this bonus increases, (Maybe even have the bonus only work on wins, for an incentive to try harder too). \n I know there's the problem of high ELO already having plenty of IP, but I personally believe it would be nice  to give the players a choice in choosing the incentive,  or  their preferred roles.

I'm still \"the one he comes home to\" figuratively speaking since we don't live together. I've met his dad, he's going to meet my mom in a few weeks... but I feel so sad and uncomfortable about this. He's a much more outgoing person than I am, who makes friends easily and flirts about as naturally as he breathes, so even without an open relationship I'd still be dealing with this to some extent. \n How does a more introverted and private person deal with having such an outgoing SO? Do I just learn to deal with it? I mean it's not as if I don't have my own things to do, I have a small business on the side of working full time, but the emotional aspect of it is driving me crazy. \n The good news is that I was allowed to set the terms of the openness and one of them was that it was a three month \"trial period\", and he said I can change my mind if I want to. But he really wants to try this out, and I worry that he would resent it if I changed my mind. I know that outgoing people don't appreciate a SO who wants a lot of their attention and care, and that by allowing him to go out and indulge himself he might stay more happy in the relationship.

Good for them! \n Jupiter is basically bed bound. I reckon she hasn't actually been in the kitchen cooking for herself in about 10-15 years. Now that she's on the diet and all excited about losing some weight she managed to get herself out of her bedroom and to the kitchen to fix dinner for everyone. \nShe did a pretty good job. Big salad (no dressing), baked chicken (no breading), water (no soda), collard greens (no butter). I have to point out how very, very difficult it must have been for her to complete this task. Doing the basic chores we all take for granted is a massive undertaking for someone in her condition. \n Granny Ham and 3 Auntie Planets sit down with their salad as a first course while the chicken and collard greens finish. \n3 Auntie Planets eat their salad as you do.\nGranny ham inspects her salad. Frowns. \n>You can't eat cucumbers with the skin on. You have to peel the skin off! You can't eat the skin! on and on and on about the skin! \n Granny ham is squealing now, jowls shaking, beads of sweat running down from her dyed orange-but-supposed-to-be-red hair. I'm not sure she's even saying words now. It's just squeals and grunts.\nJupiter is nearly in tears. We'll remind ourselves again how difficult even the simplest chore is for her. Fixing this meal is to her what running a marathon is to you and I. \nJupiter calls my father (her brother) later that evening and tells him what happened. He is LIVID. \n He went over there the next day. I was not privy to that particular conversation, but from what I understand he blessed Granny ham out. Much yelling, much squealing. \n After all, if you want to eat yourself to an early, greasy grave that's fine and that's your prerogative as an adult, but why do you have to dump shit on Jupiter, who is in a desperate struggle for her life?!? Jupiter is straight-up gonna die if she doesn't get this under control. It may be too late already. Why do you gotta fuck with her mind even more? [summary]: "}

{"input_text": "Hello /r/relationships! \n Sorry for this long post, but I need to get it off my chest and figure out something to help my family. \n I am a long time lurker here and I would like to start by saying big \"Thank You!\" to everyone posting here. I feel like I have learned a lot about how things should work and this sub helped me to realize that I have been in an abusive/unhealthy romantic relationship. Anyway, I am posting here because this time I have no idea how to handle current situation with family. \n Let's start from the beginning. My father [49M now] started working abroad shortly after I was born. It was around 8 months per year and for the rest of the year he was staying at home with us. It was awesome and I still remember talking about science, computers, cosmos for many hours at sleepless nights. He made me the curious guy I am right now. \n When I turned around 10 (IIRC) he lost this \"season\" (not sure if it is appropriate word in English) job, but it was matter of days for him to find a new one, in the same location, about 1500KM away from our hometown. One issue - it was full time contract, full year away from home. He still works at this company. Around the same time, my younger brother [15M now] was born, so we were alone with my mom [43F now]. \n It was hard, but we somehow got used to it and I hate to say that. Of course, we visited dad for 2-2.5 months during holidays every year and he would come back home for around 1 month every Christmas. It is worth adding that my mom would work with him for around 2-3 months a year, but this was the case only until my brother came to this world. \n I believe this gives you a basic overview of our \"family\" model and I guess you can imagine what kind of problems to expect. I do not want to make this post too long, so I will give you a bit more context and outline issues we struggle with. \n Important contextual information: \n \n I always had very good relationship with both of my parents, they are very loving and caring people. I am thankful for the opportunities they have created for me and I would not be the person I am without all the help and love coming from them. I can't think of any bad things to mention here. My mom was always bit nervous and struggles with my younger bro (school grades, bla bla), but you can't blame her, he pretty much raised us both alone. \n I have a very good relationship with my brother, I consider him my best friend and we do a lot of stuff together; \n I started working around ~16, become fully independent at 18. Right now, I could afford to help my parents financially if needed; \n While I stopped visiting dad for longer periods of time when I turned 18 (because of work, girlfriend etc.), I still visit him for 1-2 weeks every year and of course we spend Christmas together and other holidays as well. He sometimes gets 1 week off, but only 1-2 times a year; \n I can't say that my parents have a healthy relationship, but they have been faithful all these years, talking EVERY day for several hours on Skype. Of course, they have grown apart because of the distance and very different characters. \n \n OK, I think this is enough of context, now to the issues: \n \n My mom is heavily depressed, on meds for some time already (~1-2 years I think). She has been unemployed for almost 10 years now. Or 20 if you do not count the 2-3 months seasonal work during the first years of their marriage. She has some close friends, but obviously she struggles with loneliness, is stressed and spends most of the time at home. I try to visit her often, take her and my brother for some dinner or cinema, but that is not enough; \n \n My dad is heavily depressed and started abusing alcohol. It is so hard to type it, because I would never expect that to happen to him. Now I now it was naive, but really, I don't remember him drinking even a beer at home. It started few years ago with \"just a beer or two a day to relax after stressful work\". Now he seems to be drunk on Skype few times a week and it is definitely not beer. We see that he tries to stop for several days or even a week, but then it starts all over again. When drunk, he is not aggressive or anything, just very emotional, overthinking everything and sometimes talking stupid stuff. He is quite jealous about my mom, but this is really ridiculous because I am 100% sure she has always been faithful. He has no friends there and spends all the time at work and in front of computer. Talking with us, watching movies or playing games. He has never been a \"party-monster\" (the character difference I mentioned above), but I remember my parents had social life when I was little. Not is appears to be non-existent for both of them. Of course, my dad is also really upset about how financials are managed with him being the only supporter of the family. \n \n \n Woah, it feels both good and bad to write it down. Good because I feel a little relief and finally start doing something about it, but on the other hand... this is so sad and hard. :( I somehow feel responsible for all this, not sure why. \n Things I have tried so far: \n \n Bringing back my dad home. We have talked about it 214123243 times and now he does not want to hear it at all. I proposed finding him a job here, starting his own company, where I could help him with everything, including financing. He is so talented. He can fix and build anything. Electronics, cars, gardens... building a house? He can do it all and is very good at it. Of course, company is a lot of stress and full time job in our country does not pay very well, but it would be definitely enough to support a family of 3 and also my mom could start some work as well to support him; \n Finding a job/school for my mom. She is not willing to take a low-paying full-time job. On the other hand, she has no education. I wanted to get her into 2-year school that is in line with her interests. I see she wants it badly, but she is so scared and does not make the first step. She said she is too old for school, but damn, she looks like a 30!!! \n Moving everyone there permanently. This is something we have discussed many times, but there are many issues with school, language etc. and everyone feels it is many years too late for that. \n \n I am perfectly aware of the fact that it would be tremendously hard for them to live together again, but I feel like this is the only way. Otherwise, everything will get even worse. \n What breaks my heart is that neither of them really wants to do something about it. They see the issues, they would like to make everyone happy, but at the same time they do not want to live together. This is how it looks to me. \n Is there any way I could help them? I am really worried and I know that these are the last moments before things go really wrong and there is no going back. I can't imagine the future if nothing changes. I fear about their mental and physical health. I want my future children to have healthy grandparents and finally have a real family dinner every Sunday. \n Thank you for any ideas and suggestions.

Popular figures being derided for suggesting that there are other paths to salvation; as if even stating such open mindedness (despite having a record of good works) would immediately result in a sentence to eternal hellfire. From Tebow's single-track to the eternally incorrect statement of 'Jesus is the reason for the season'. (What season? Winter? The holiday season? What about Hanukkah, Kwanzaa, Yule or New Years?) Jesus is the reason we decorate a tree with bulbs?  The gift giving was from the 3 wise men, right? [No.]( \n I could go on in the same vein, but I am trying to point out something about respect and human-kindness, and flying off the handle isn't going to do it. \n This was my path. \n As if it wasn't obvious, I am not a christian. I have read the bible, front to back, several different translations, several different times. I have spoken with many denominations. Attended many churches. I have books upon books of religious history and commentary. I did (and continue) my homework. I felt it necessary to pinpoint what I don't like about organized religion; using christianity and judaism, the religions most accessible to me. In a nutshell - I cannot trust a body of men who consolidate power to seize control over freedom of thought. No matter that organization be secular, government or religious in nature, whether that organization use money, laws or infallible interpretation of scripture to do so. \n The answers I sought and found came from within me: influenced by a variety of books, personal experience, compassion, and logic. It works for me, pushes me to be a better, more understanding person. When I fail to live up to my expectations; I evaluate, attempt to learn, progress and make amends. For no more reason than that it is right. \n As the Dali Lama once said, \"I have come to the conclusion that whether or not a person is a religious believer does not matter much. Far more important is that they be a good human being.\u201d If your belief in Yeshua, Yahweh, Allah, Brahman, Nirvana, or even Ahura Mazda, pushes you to be good and considerate to your fellow man and has the added bonus of providing you peace and contentment - how can judgement not fall in your favor? When you act with compassion first, grace is with you. \n I am sorry if it personally offends you that I do not believe I need to be saved by anyone or any-being besides myself. The only devil that tempts me is within, strength is given to me by the good results of fighting those demons. There is no evil demigod to coerce me to a hell where good people and loved ones may burn forever based on their acceptance or refusal of a set of dogma. God reserves the right to judge. No one else gets that right because of cherry-picked laws from conflicting accounts of scripture. \n In keeping with my beliefs, I try very hard not to spit out knee jerk reactions to all this Jesus\u2122, which, to me, has little to do with Yeshua, a jew from Galilee who was probably just trying to make things a bit better for people. \n This is the greatest failure in what institutionalized religion has done to us. We forget the message of peace, providing for the poor, and humility. We are barraged about how to act, who to vote for, and the arbitrary judgement of damnation on those with good hearts who don't believe as the institution says it should. \n Yet I understand the drive in those of the conversion religions. God spoke to a chosen man (or angel) who dictated to another chosen man that everyone must believe as dictated, or they are going to hell. If the chosen fail to warn people of this, the chosen could also go to hell. Yes, it's 'Good News': no one has to burn forever for failing to know about eating the flesh and blood of Christ. Also, (despite Matthew 6.5) it seems that if christians fail to praise Him on the street corners and continual Facebook updates, they are also going to hell. So, given that belief system, there is a pretty powerful motivator to get the word out. \n But that brings me to my point on courtesy. There are a lot of things I am passionate about (besides religion) that I love to talk about (unlike religion). My family, especially my daughter, video games (skyrim, skyrim, skyrim), books (Game of Thrones, Wheel of Time, history, secular, religious, travel), F1. But I realize these interests are not shared by everyone. I would never degrade anyone for failing to think as I did, though I might even push my opinions/obsessions now and again. Really sell it, you know? \n But there is more to me than that. I don't want to constantly sell to people. Some aren't into what I like, don't believe as I do. I try to be mindful of this as I go through life, everything in moderation. Take time to listen, find common ground, gain perspective and learn. We are here to focus on learning more than we are here to teach. No one has to change the way they feel, but it might let us enjoy our time together in life more constructively, if we build on respect. \n I work constantly (for it is always a battle against the demon of haste) to respect the opinions and differences of other people. We have a lot to learn from each other. Just because someone has a different opinion/hat/religion than the cultural norm does not make them a terrorist, satan-spawn, or subversive. To picture them that way makes them less than human and much easier to treat with a lack of dignity. We can do better to bridge gaps, build a stronger world and raise a more tolerant generation. For in the end, will God be more concerned with those you condemned or your actions toward your fellow man? [summary]: "}
{"input_text": "So, last night my girlfriend got really upset with me and wouldn't talk to me or come near me. I honestly didn't know what I'd done and when I asked her about it she said to drop it because she didn't want to talk about it. (yesterday was her Birthday) \n So today I found out what it was but I'll tell you what I thought happened first. \n We were at her parents after a day spent at the beach with her family, it was really nice and I felt like we were really close. So we go back to hers and are sat in the conservatory for a while talking with her parents and sister. I checked my phone a couple of times when not much was being said, just to look at Facebook. A couple of times her parents began talking to me and I put the phone down and obviously talked to them. But then my girlfriend got really distant, moving away from me when I sat next to her and just not speaking to me. \n Her parents asked her to show me one of the gifts they got her. It was one of those buy-a-star things. She got it and sat with her parents and showed them. Her parents kept saying \"go sit with (me), show him\" but she just said no and that she can't be assed moving. At this point I feel really alienated and singled out so I'm on my phone even more trying to not look like a twat because no one is talking to me and she won't even look at me. \n She goes to her room so I follow her and ask her whats up and tell her I love her but she says she doubts it, so I ask what I did. She asks if I know and I'm honestly oblivious. She then walks back downstairs to be with everyone and completely blanks me a while longer. Eventually we end up in her room, talking and cuddling like nothing has happened and I'm telling her how much she means to me but she says she still doesn't want to talk about it until tomorrow (today). \n So I wake up today and shes being really blunt with me, I ask her why and she says it's because I was on my phone all night last night. She thinks I kept shuffling away from her to go on it in private so she can't see what I'm doing but that's not what I was trying to do at all. It wasn't a conscious decision to move away from her, it's just... I dunno, what happened and she's taken it the wrong way. \n Now she's saying she doesn't know if she wants me at all. She always said shes been so happy with me and that I've changed her life for the better but today she said she's unhappy a lot of the time but she does love me and doesn't know what to do. \n She said she can't trust me. I'm honestly not sure why, she thinks I lie to her but I don't. We dated about 4 years ago and decided to try again, the previous time I did lie to her a few times and she found out each time. Just little things, like saying I was home when I was going to the shop. They were stupid lies, not to cover anything up, I honestly don't know why. But I'm so honest with her now. \n She says every guy before her has cheated on her and thats why she can't trust me now. And 2 of her ex's also abused her, one of them is even on the sex offenders list now because of it. But another problem is that I have a higher sex drive than her and she feels like thats a problem. When I try to initiate sex she just kind of turns away so I drop it but then she'll say Im being 'huffy' for the rest of the night when it really doesn't bother me and I try to just move on and do something else with her.

According to who?  From my personal experience, this is not true. As a military pilot who did a log of CAS and FAC-A, I loved working with the A-10.  It's still pretty low tech compared to other platforms (pilots will often write on the canopy with a grease pencil) but it does what it does very well.  The author assumes that these aircraft are interchangeable in their missions.  It's like comparing a hammer to a knife and saying that chefs really don't like said hammer. \n \n The f-117 was at best a prototype that was rushed into combat because there was a need. There are any platforms that are better used today than that but technology has grown a lot since 1991. A lot changes in 25 years.  Assuming we even need to employ it in the same way is seriously flawed. \n \n The JSF is expensive and complex because the needs are complex. I won't get in on the discussion if how it is managed because I don't know enough about it but saying the Marine need for a VSTOL capability is outdated means that he doesn't know how the military uses Marine Air. The need comes from the need for fixed wing support on a MEU (Marine Expeditionary Unit). They deploy them on ships with short flight deck and no arresting gear. Without this capability, the ability to quickly strike a deeper target is removed. \n \n A new aircraft design cannot be low observable, maneuverable, and have specialized performance (VSTOL). Is it easy? No. It is a serious engineering challenge which is why it takes some of the best minds in the business and why everyone doesn't or can't do it but why would any new design not use modern military technologies in the design?

{"input_text": "My dad was an electrical engineer for a small firm that did exclusive contract work for the air force, and I like to ask about what he did. I'm also currently studying electrical engineering and my professors like to talk about their work from before they went into teaching. \n \"Open-ended-problem-solver\" is a bit of an misnomer. \n What an engineer usually does is a ton of math to find a very specific solution to a very specific problem and then judge whether or not their solution is effective in terms of cost, efficiency, the time to upgrade existing technology, and whatever costs one solution may have over existing solutions (in electrical engineering we like to say that nothing is free). \n For example, the US Air Force had several issues related to radio signals in the mid 80s. Military aircraft are constantly talking to each other, some command center, scanning with radar, and monitoring a large spectrum of radio frequencies. If missiles are firing off, you probably want to know whose missiles are whose and if they're coming after you. You also don't want the enemy to hear any of your communications or knowing if your missiles are locked on to their air craft. \n One problem that my dad's company was hired to solve was to build a device that could be retrofitted onto existing aircraft that could sort out a whole host of radio signals and determine their origin, USAF or Soviet and to disrupt missile locking signals. \n On top of the problem they had to solve, the engineers were also tasked with finishing the project in six months because that's when the aircraft carrier was next in port near their headquarters. It was in port for a week, so the engineers also had to make sure all the units the USAF ordered were installed in that week. \n First the engineers all sat down and worked out all the math that had to be done and solved a lot of complex differential equations. Next they had to design a system that would implement the transfer functions they had worked out. After designing the system, they would have to work it into a collection of circuits and analyze them to make sure it would work in theory. Then they had to prototype the systems and adjust because nothing ever works on the first try (according to my dad, they used to take bets on how accurate the first prototypes were to the models). After prototyping it, they had to shrink it down to the size and weight requirements, then build one unit and test it for accuracy and quality. After this, they had to manufacture all the units ordered and test them all to make sure they were perfect. \n If I recall correctly, they actually weren't able to solve all the problems they were contracted to solve.

Seeing as I was not the root cause of this issue I confront my manager and ask him what it was he was doing. \n I get a rather defensive response and to avoid the question he barrages me with question after question and motivational talk about how we need to work together to fix this issue.

{"input_text": "While I agree that there is too much put into the performance and \"it must be perfect before Sunday\" I think there is a fine line that is very easy to cross. \n I grew up in a charismatic church that had a worship team that yes, knew their instrument, but they were (and still are) not performers. They are leaders of worship. About 6 years ago I started going to a new church, closer to home, targeted for my age group (they focus on the 20-40 year old men who have been far from Christ, especially those who struggle with addiction). My brother is the lead worship Pastor there and a very wise man of God. He has had a constant struggle with what is appropriate and what isn't. When he has a team member who is there to obviously perform, he asks them to take a step back and focus on their relationship with Jesus. This has hurt people, but I know that it has helped everyone on the team focus on leading the congregation in worship. \n I think the hard part for many of these churches, is the fact that thy are trying (successfully) to reach the unchurched. By providing them with awesome music that is accompanied by the Gospel. If you give the people in church, what they want, they will be less likely to go find that on a Friday or Saturday night with copious amounts of alcohol and other shenanigans that follow large crowds and loud music. \n I think the fine line is, keeping the message focused on Jesus and making the perfection of the service a by-product of the hard work we are doing for Him. \n One thing that bothers me just a little bit is the weight most of these churches also focus on the message of Grace. Especially in the demographic that is being targeted. Yes, it is important for people to know they are forgiven, yesterday today and tomorrow. Creating grace abusers is a dangerous thought. \n I recently just started going to my previous church again and it has been SO hard getting back into the \"well whatever happens, as long as God moves, practice doesn't have to go perfect....heck! Service doesn't even have to be perfect\" but it has been rewarding and I know I will only continue to grow in my faith. It has also made me realize how much focus was put on the performance. When I do worship at my old church (where my brother leads) I worship my freaking heart out. I know the songs, they have a beautiful message. I am a bit biased though, because my brother is a prodigy and has the most amazing voice and musical talents of anyone I know. He could easily have gone the route of rock star and made millions and he is using his talents to point people to Jesus and I think that's pretty cool. [summary]: "}

{"input_text": "Maybe you let them fend for themselves on acreage? They wouldn't starve, right? \n They could, depending on your area - I assume you're talking about an amount of acreage that you know is enough, but even then there could be times of year where the nutrition is almost non-existent. \n Here in the mountains in southern Oregon, I had 5 goats that did great on 6 acres for the first two years.  I barely fed them supplemental alfalfa, even in the winter - just provided kelp and copper mineral mix (the soils here are very deficient in almost all minerals). \n But by year three, they'd killed off most of the brush in the 6 acres, and the tree branches they could reach.  So when the dry season (July-September) rolled around again and all the grass/flowers/weeds went dormant, there was nothing they could find.  They chewed on the brush branches that were left, but even those had pulled most of the moisture/nutrients down into the roots so there wasn't much food. \n The local ruminants at this point head up in elevation to where there's food available, but I don't have land that covers a diversity of elevations so my goats didn't have that option.  That's when I saw my food bill start to climb. \n And since I don't have enough land to let the shrubs recover while the goats forage in a different section, I'm now providing almost 100% of their feed as hay.  I cross-fenced the 6 acres so some sections can recover, but that means they've completely stripped the smaller areas they're confined to now - the shrubs in those sections are dead, and they're starting on the trees (stripping the bark all the way around).  Until we get more land, that seems to be the cost. \n In addition, my Nubian goats are from some heavy milking lines, and it's becoming apparent that some of them can't get enough nutrition without concentrated calories (grains) once they reach their second year of milking and start pumping out at full production.  I'm sure they reduce their milk production to some extent, but there's a floor where they'll keep producing gallons of milk and just start using up their bodies to do it.  I don't want to see the results if I let it keep going, so I supplement them with store-bought grain (since I'm using my land to provide forage, not to grow grain) and in some cases even add oil for more calories.

When we started off we had sex any and everywhere and averaged 10 times a week at least.  I would say that at the time of the incident we were still going at it pretty hot and heavy but maybe only fucking 6 times a week or so.  Then there was a short period of time about 2 years ago where we once went almost 3 months with no sex at all.  It was definitely the topic of tense conversation for a while.  Then six months ago or so, we had a big heart to heart about it and things are very good again.  We only get to have sex once or twice a week because of our crazy schedules and the children, but the sex is exceptional and passionate... we have hands on each other at every opportunity... and if we can sneak in another quickie, then we often will. \n Recently, there was an issue about me jerking-off that caused a bit of an arguement and some hurt feelings, but it seems like after much discussion, we have come to a good place about it. \n BUT, during the couple of arguements that we had about jerking off, I remembered the lesbian profile I found a while ago and it started really eating at me. \n there are two things about the profile that bother me; \n 1)  When asked by me, she always says that she doesn't have any sexual fantasies and that she just loves the way I fuck her and pound her pussy so good and that she doesn't need anything else.  Well, on that profile she listed a sexual fantasy that was roughly;  \"I want to have an all girl orgy with a few girls, some champagne, and anything goes.\" \n 2)  Sometimes, she'll act a bit put off if I try to kiss her after eating her pussy, but also in that profile she said [roughly from memory];  \"I'm so good at eating pussy that one time I ate a girl out on the [metro-north commuter] train and no one even knew.\"  -- Like I said, sometimes she'll act put off and then sometimes it's no big deal.  Recently she even said after kissing me, \"I can taste my pussy on your lips when you kiss me.\"  This all just leaves me a bit confused.  She's always been very oral with me too.  So much so that she gets SOAKED just from sucking my cock. \n One side note, there were at least 2 occasions where she met up with other girls.  I'm 90% sure that she met them at the bar but didn't go home with them.  Both times, she told me she was meeting up with an old friend from high school or college and one of the times even told me she was meeting her at a lesbian bar.  Both times I picked her up at some point at or near the bars before it got too late or before she would have gotten the chance to go somewhere to fuck.  We live in NYC,  btw. \n Also, she was open with me that she only really dated women before me.  She dated one guy but she never did anything but oral with him. \n So, now here I am.  I'm terrified and curious at the same time to ask her about it.  Has it been too long and should I just forget it?

{"input_text": "Imbalance in video games is an interesting topic, as true balance is impossible without everyone being exactly the same. With a class based game like team fortress, imbalance is expected, and is really what makes the game worth playing. \n Take for example rock paper scissors, if you play rock, you will always beat scissors, and never beat paper. Take a pure skill based game on the other hand, so whoever has the best aim/game knowledge/strategy wins, so someone with more skill will always beat someone with less skill. \n Each of these has its upsides and downsides, and there are people who will argue that one or the other is superior, but take both in equal amounts and you get something like TF2, where for teams with equal skill the better team makeup will win, and for teams with equal makeup the team with more skill will win. \n To balance a game like this, where skill is a variable the developers have no control over, the solution is to make a meta game as interesting and variable as possible, without making classes that beat/loose to everyone all the time with skill being irrelevant, and without classes that are all grey and strategy is non-existent. \n You have to find the correct balance where you can kill every class as every class, but where some classes are just plain better at killing others, but without making the playing field so unbalanced that skill and fun just go out the window. In order to have varied classes with varied skills, you need imbalance, but you need imbalance in all directions. [summary]: "}

{"input_text": "I'm reposting a comment I wrote from a different post requesting for advice on motivation for last minute studying for finals. \n \n Try to figure out what the  best environment  for you is. Either a place outside your home (library, coffeeshop), or at home (desk, kitchen table), and before you open up anything to work on, spend 5 minutes removing any and all distractions. \n \n Books, put 'em away. \n \n Cell phone (even if you need this one, put it away where you can hear it, but can not see it; answer phone calls from people you NEED to take calls from (boss, mom, dad,  NOT  friends)). Even better, set up important people you need to take calls from with a specific ringtone so you won't even have to check the ID. \n \n Poster of a movie you like infront of your desk? Take it down and move it to the other side of the room. \n \n \n You want to place yourself in the best possible position to succeed. I remember, at one point the other year, I had to resort to shutting my laptop down and placing it under a bunch of towels in the linen closet. So make sure that you are ruthless with whatever hinders you the most. \n If you're like me and you know that the instant you open your computer that you will lose yourself for hours: \n \n have a pen & notepad handy \n \n hide your computer away from yourself (leave it home if you study elsewhere, or turn it off (not sleep mode) and place it out of sight  And. Do. Not. Touch. It! ). \n \n Every time you are tempted to open it, even to just look something up for school, write down what you want to look up in the notebook. Get as far as you can in studying and researching without your computer. If you need to write an essay, at least do the outline and research in writing before prying your laptop's screen up. Then, when you're done studying, you can go back over everything you wanted to do in your notebook, and do it. \n \n \n Even if you think you can crack that laptop open for just a minute before you study, the moment you do so, you are lost. Or at least that's how I am. 1 minute = 2 lost hours. \n And when you finally do have to use your computer to write an essay, turn its wifi off. Or if you need the internet, limit yourself to a couple tabs and keep that number open, no more. Or go someplace public where a lot of students are studying and do your online research there so you'll be too embarrassed to be seen procrastinating by peers, and will maintain your focus a bit more. Try forcing yourself to sit with your screen facing everyone, and not the wall behind you. \n And the last thing I'll say is: You  will  eventually need to take a break! Figure out what kind of things you'll do for breaks before you even sit down to study, because it sure can't be your old friend Computer. How about your older friend Cookie? Or maybe a book and a timer? Origami? Write down, \"I am  wonderful  for studying for X hours today\" on a piece of paper, fold it into a paper airplane and fly it out your window? Stretching your muscles? You want your break to be enough of a pause from working that you don't feel like you're slogging your way through chemistry, engineering, and literature for days and days on end. Pace yourself with evenly spaced breaks to both chill and eat your three square meals (or at minimum, some decently nutritious snacks). Those tiny wind-down distractions can help you remember what you're studying more. It's the bigger distractions that will stop you from studying period. [summary]: "}

If you are referring to the racism, hatred and general ignorance of the people you knew, it is not because the military brainwashed them.  It was about their upbringing.  The Corps made it more socially acceptable in a sense to accept and voice these things because they would be dehumanizing the enemy.

Somehow, I got talked into taking around 10 or 11 shots in about an hour and a half. Then, I stumble over to this party. Once inside, I get convinced to take another 2 shots (chocolate cake shots; outrageously delicious), and I drank 2 or 3 beers.. After we've been there for an hour or so, I go up to the roof to have a smoke with a friend. We get up there, and start talking. I can tell that I'm pretty drunk, and that's an important realization, because it's right then that I black out. \n Now, I don't know if you've ever blacked out, but it's a pretty weird feeling. It's like the time between blacking out and coming to just doesn't exist. At all. \n So I come to a few hours later talking to a policeman. I have no idea where I am, how I've gotten there, or why I'm talking to a policeman. But I come to in the middle of a sentence and I know that I'm trying to get him to take me home. I argue with him for a bit, but he keeps saying something that I can't understand about having to wait. So, for no apparent reason, it suddenly becomes the greatest idea in the world to sit down. So I do. Immediately. If I hadn't been standing right next to the cop car, I'd have fallen straight to the ground. Instead, I sit down on his brush guard. I think he's mad about it, but what is he really gonna say to someone as hammered as I was? \n Eventually, a white van shows up and two nice people took me by the arms and got me to sit in the back. I gave them directions back to my home (which didn't really work, since I didn't know where we started from), and they didn't care. So eventually I got pulled out of the van and had to sit down in a chair and get my vital signs taken. They breathalyzed me and told me that I had an outrageous amount of alcohol in my system. Then, someone led me into another room and pointed at the ground and said sleep. So I slept. \n After I made it home, friends said they lost track of me about three hours after we made it to the party.

He was so loving, attentive, caring, he actually wanted to spend time with me, and sex was amazing. We \"got\" and understood each other. We had fun together. We didn't even need to actually do anything in order to have fun. Just being together was enough. Cuddling was so much fun. There's a lust we had for each other that I cannot describe in words. We have the same taste in music and movies. We understood each other's flirting and jokes. Boy, did we always make each other laugh. \n I've had other boyfriend before, but my feelings towards him were something different.

Personal issues at home for me, and financial/job issues for my ex. I started getting angrier and angrier, and I let my anger out on my ex a lot. I really tried to work on it and started seeing a psychologist. \n One of the most troubling flaws my ex had was he was an extremely private person. I trusted him. But he would lie about things here and there and it would unsettle me. Whenever I would confront him about it, he would not say anything. I will give you two examples: \n I knew he hated his work and I had time to kill before class. I decided to write him a cute little note and stick it on his bike. I know where he puts his bike. It wasn't there so I look for his car... wasn't there either. I later ask him if he went to work and he said yes, and told him about the bike. He said he brought it upstairs (knowing the efficient person he is, he would never do that. It wasn't raining, it was a safe neighborhood, there's really no reason). \n I brushed it off. But it still bugged me. \n Another thing is orchestra. I wasn't able to go to my orchestra class one time and I ask him how it went. He said \"Eh. I missed you :(\" I took that as orchestra was \"eh.\" \n Though my best friend said that he didn't come. I ask my ex about it, and he tried to avoid the question. Then he explained it to me as \n \"'Eh' was because I didn't want to take the time to explain, like I already said several times. Me missing you was independent of that.\" (he had to help out his family with something). \n Ok, I thought. He's also the worst talker but something in me tells me he was lying because I started to get the feeling that he was interested in someone else (which I used to get with the guy before him, never failed... that was an unhealthy relationship.) \n As time went on, I could see he didn't know how he felt about me because his face no longer looked warm when he would tell me he loved me. He would also look away when saying it. \n He then wanted a break. I thought it was going to last 2 weeks or something, but I had to end it at 4 months... I couldn't take it anymore. I really wanted us to work out. My paranoia + his privateness was starting to not work out. We broke up October 2012. \n He also didn't want to hang out with me anymore. When we used to have fun together, we did nothing. Now he had to ask \"but what will we do?\" \n I've dated other people, but I still have strong feelings for him. I've gotten over him a couple of times, but my feelings return. \n In July, he went to camp with a Boy Scouts troop and on his free time he would go on his OKCupid. I made one and he and I got matched up. Told him about it, and he disabled his account, only to enable it later and started asking me all of these sexual questions. This was when I had a boyfriend at the time (he knew I had an OKC, I was just checking out stuff and met some cool people). My ex also knew I had a boyfriend. Every Saturday on his breaks he would visit my profile and check out the questions answered. It broke my heart, considering how we broke up and all. I wondered if he still had feelings for me, even though he said he was only curious. Oh, there were also pretty attractive girls in his group, and he had friends there.

{"input_text": "Hi pettyrevenge, long time lurker, first time poster and all that jazz. Apologies if this turns into a wall of text. \n The Backstory \n I worked at a ski resort as a reservations agent, with high hopes of a promotion after a year of working in the call center. 6 months into my employment, my manager decides to hire \"The Bitch\". To make a long story short, TB came to us from Big Wireless Company as a supervisor where it was apparent that she had only gotten by on her good looks and charm. She was uesless as an entry level manager. She was manipulative, obnoxious, stuck-up, and she slept around with resort staff, then blabbed to the agents all about their personal, ahem, \"attributes\" (good guys who were my friends and didn't deserve that kind of treatment). \n From the start it was obvious that TB and I would have problems. She coudn't supervise worth a shit, ignored our concerns and questions, created drama in an office where drama had no place being, and was generally lackadaisical about being there. I knew I could do her job a thousand times better than her, and in a very diplomatic way, made this clear to my manager. The other agents and I did not hide the fact that we thought TB was doing a shit job, however she and the manager had a personal friendship outside work so she stayed on. \n The Story \n So the day finally comes when I've had enough. TB has come in late one too many times, fucked around on her \"boyfriend\" of the week one too many times, asked me idiotic personal questions one too many times, and acted like a friend to my face then went and threw me under the bus one too many times. \n TB is talking to someone from another department while I get up to go to the bathroom. I stop by her desk, as we are the only two agents at work right now. \n \"TB, I am going to the bathroom. I'm taking myself out of the queue, so if any calls come in they're going to go to you, ok?\" \n I am ignored but we made eye contact, so I trust that she heard me. I do my business and come back. When I sit down at my computer, I notice that TB has taken herself out of queue, effectively closing the call center during business hours.  THIS IS A HUGE NO-NO!! . Even if, by some act of god she'd been struck both blind and deaf when I got up to leave, she still would have seen on the computer that she was the only one in queue..she knew damn well. \n I confront her, and not in the calmest way I should have. It starts with me asking why she's out of queue and as she feeds me excuse after excuse, I get angrier and angrier. I ask to speak to her in another room, where it devolves into me shaking with rage at her and her throwing that holier-than-thou attitude my way. I finally tell her I don't like her, and we agree that we need to work on our professional reationship. We leave it at that and I am at least happy we dealt with it ourselves. \n That afternoon, TB approaches me and says we're going down to visit The Big Cheese...the dept head. I bet you know where this is going. I ask her if it's about what happend earlier and she says she doesn't know.  THIS IS BULLSHIT . When we get there I am reprimanded, written up, and sent home for the day. It goes on my permanent file. I. am. pissed. \n The Revenge \n Fast forward another 6 months. TB and I have worked on our professional relationship, and I can tolerate her enough to do my job and let her do hers (which still hasn't changed..if anything, she got worse). I am still asking my manager to speak with TB about her attitude towards the agents, and her general lack of desire to actually \"supervise us\". She just wants to fuck the bar staff and talk on her cell all day. \n One night, after a long weekend over which TB had gone on vacation, she's due to come back from the airport and hasn't arrived to work yet. My manager gets a text saying she's on her way. 2 hours later, she's still not at work. Manager is getting pissed, because this is now following months of blatent lies and manipulation, so we all know something is up. When TB finally arrives, all smiles and cheer, she is whisked away to see The Big Cheese. 15 minutes later my manager comes back to gather TB's things. \n Because it's a small resort and TB still had friends there, we learned that she had been offered reduced work hours and more responsibility, which she had turned down. We believed this, until a few weeks later when I visited with another agent and she admitted that TB hadn't been given a choice like she told us - she was outright fired. \n A week later, I was offered the position of Supervisor and I took it with glee.

{"input_text": "Cup. \n For a lot of my post high-school life, I was called \"Jesus\" due to the long hair and beard.  Well, a few years back, I frequented a bar in the French Quarter of New Orleans.  Made friends with the bartenders (even hooked one up with one of my friends, they have a kid together) and I was soon known by everyone there.  Well, the owner decided to have little plaques made up with the names of all the regulars and cover the top of the bar with them.  Naturally, I was on the list.  Unfortunately, they misspelled my last name.  The plaque, to this day, reads \"Marc \"Jesus\" Grail.\"  My last name is not grail.

{"input_text": "This post is a follow-up to my story from last week [here]( \n First, I want to thank the community for the support as soon as I posted the story.  I literally wanted to just throw the whole thing in the trash after it happened as I was sure everything was toast.  Hell, it was going to be an excuse to get a mATX build going finally.  However, you guys gave me tons of help (and a few laughs) which definitely helped. \n [Here]( are the pictures, wish I would have taken more/better ones but got caught up in the process.  I followed /u/adumbgorilla's advice to remove everything and soak in alcohol.  Ordered 99.9% Isopropyl Alcohol from Amazon after reading his suggestion and waited till Wednesday to start the disassemble process.  I figured waiting wouldn't cause any additional damage and I had to wait for the alcohol to be delivered anyways. \n Fast-forward to Wednesday and you can follow along in the pictures.  The alcohol was incredibly sticky and little crystals of rock hard sugar were everywhere.  I removed the Ram, took off the casings and dropped them in the alcohol.  Next, took off the cooler and inspected the CPU.  Luckily there was only a small spot of sugar on the side and it came off easily with the Arctic Silver thermal paste cleaner. \n Next, took off the lower GPU and opened it up.  After removing the exterior casing, it looked like it was extremely clean except for the shell.  Just wiped the shell off and cleaned the ports.  Next, the GPU on top was out and pulled apart.  This thing definitely took the brunt of the assault.  Removed the shell, fan, and heatsink and dropped it in the alcohol.  Removed the hard drives, wiped them down, and set aside. Took the hard drive racks and plopped them in.  At this point, I was down to the PSU and Mobo. \n At this point, I ran into my biggest problem.  I was running a 2500k and figured my mobo was toast.  It was so soaked, sugar filled every port, that I just saw it as a lost cause.  Furthermore, I was worried about putting a potentially good part into the mobo then frying that part.  So I knew I needed another sandy-bridge compatible mobo but I was really frustrated that I might be buying an old mobo, have a ton of non-working parts, then have an older mobo with no purpose.  At this point, my friend pointed out that he had an extra EVGA P67 SLI board that he wasn't using.  I took it off him (still owe him a lot of beer for that one) and pressed on. \n The PSU was a really scary one for me.  I get freaked out easily from the thought of electrical fires so really didn't think it was worth chancing cleaning the PSU if it got really messy during the spill.  To my surprise, the PSU was fine, it barely had any spots at all and the fan didn't suck up anything.  The cables were pretty gross but I wiped those down with a rag/alcohol and cleaned the ports with a toothbrush.  Tested that the PSU wasn't blown by doing the paperclip trick. \n The sugar took forever to breakdown.  I ended up leaving the ram in for 12 hours and the GPU in for a little over 24.  After I was convinced that everything was working, I took the hard drives and the second GPU (the cleanest one) and plugged into my roommates PC.  Everything worked, I was ecstatic.  Really got my hopes up at that point.  I figured best case, I'm out a GPU, worst case, I'm out a CPU/GPU/RAM/possibly a PSU still (didn't test the voltage). \n Fast-forward to today. Plugged everything in (except for first GPU) and hit power.  Everything came back up!  I was thrilled.  The crazy thing, I didn't even have to reinstalll Windows, it just came right back up.  I thought that switching out the mobo would make me reinstall but it's like nothing ever happened.  Though now, I'm getting a weird Windows Activation error but I'll just call customer support tomorrow (everything I've researched about this problem is directing me to reinstall Windows, would prefer to avoid that if possible). \n Waiting for the first GPU took dry off before I put the heatsink and fan back on.  Don't have high hopes for this one but if this process has taught me anything, you never know. [summary]: "}

{"input_text": "I think you may have the wrong idea about it. Yes, auto-tune can be overused and sound like shit, or on purpose for the effect. However, EVERY record you hear that comes out now will be autotuned, regardless if the singer can actually sing or not. People seem to think autotune makes a bad singer sound good. It does not. It does not change your tone, unless over used...and even then that's not the \"tone\" people want. You have to be within half a semi tone to make it sound correct. \nDue to things like electronic instruments, autotune, melodyne, etc...the human ear has become so used to hearing everything perfectly tuned. Go listen to some old Armstrong records or something, he goes sharp a lot on his trumpet, etc. \nNot sure if you are a fan or not, and not that it matters, but take Bruno Mars. He is an incredible singer, and is a great live performer. But they still autotune him (Though most studios use melodyne as opposed to Antares). This is because even if something is 10cents off, it's still not perfect. If you are releasing a song that you know millions of people are going to hear, and possibly buy, you want it to be perfect. \nI am willing to bet any of that musical theatre stuff you listen to, if it has been studio recorded, is tuned. \n All that being said, obviously you want to be as good of a live singer possible, but don't feel bad or ashamed or like you're \"cheating\" when you tune. This doesn't mean be lazy. Still get the best takes you can get, comp them, and then when all is said and done, tune. \n But where you say, \"I know it's been edited that it's not even worth trying\"...that's stupid. Whoever you're listening to did actually sing it and hit those notes. If someone wasn't actually hitting the note, they would do it again until they could or the song would not be sung in that key. \n Here is the way I go about recording: \nRecord around 3 takes, more if you need to. Comp (if you don't know what this means it's taking the best sections of each and making them into one track). Make fades. If needed, I tune. Though usually I just do things until they are correct.

{"input_text": "For some reason, most fringe communities tend to view my thoughts with the same ridicule that they themselves find when they speak about spirits or demons. \n Ever since I can remember (and before that, according to my mother), I have experienced the same symptoms.\n - Hearing voices of various volume & clarity \nIts never a strange voice, and its always appropriate to my location. If Im home, its my wife. At work, a coworkers voice. As a child, sibling or mother. Sometimes its mumbled, other times I can clearly hear them call my name or say a greeting. \n seeing shadows in my direct vision \nThis is an uncommon one, but tends to happen at my mothers house frequently. I will see a small (or human sized on occasion) shadow walk or move JUST out of my direct focus of vision. Sometimes Ill think its a cat or dog, but when I look down, there is no animal where the shadow just darted towards. \n seeing distinct people in my peripheral vision \nAnother one that seems to be more common in specific places. I will sometimes see distinct individuals in the corner of my eye. When I turn to address them, no ones there. It happened daily at a place I use to work at. Since Ive changed jobs, I notice it out in the community sometimes. \n sparks & glimmers of light \nOn random occasions I will be startled by a quick  pop  or spark of light within any given location of my vision. Its definitely not an internal issue with my eyes though, as I can always note the location (over by the chair. In the corner of the room, next to that tree, etc). One that happens more rarely, is this total field of vision disturbance. I will be doing whatever, and suddenly I will see what could only be described as thousands of glowing-white maggots squirming out of space itself. Then they'll wither away just as they had crawled out. \n An impossible to describe tactile sense \nIve been struggling with the words to describe this since I first felt it around the age of 8. I first felt it while taking a nap on my parents bed, and its always been associated with what Im about to describe later. But its a tactile sensation, a texture I can feel, but unlike anything I can ever mimic or truly describe. Its rough, jagged, and immensely complex in its disorder and unevenness. But its so insanely dense and focused, that its smoother than marble. I dont mean to say that the rough details are so small, that it becomes smooth. The rough peaks and edges are so large, that I can feel every distinct one, but somehow its also smoother than any stone. When I was younger, I would say,\" imagine riding rollerblades over an old concrete & pebble road, then imagine transitioning onto freshly pressed blacktop. Now imagine them both at the same time\". Also, I always feel like including the color pink into its description is appropriate. \n innacurate memories \nI usually have a great photographic memory. But occasionally, I will recall something from my childhood that absolutely EVERYONE recalls differently. Sometimes its a different choice than I recall. Sometimes the jacket I remember as red, is actually blue. I may remember owning something that my wife claims shes never seen before, or something may br brought up that I never recall owning, but apparently I do. \n my theory \n Ive never considered my 'hallucinations' as spirits or demons, because theyve always been people related to my current situation, as opposed to some weird out of place apparition. I dont believe them to be actual hallucinations either, as Ive had them my whole life, and they feel just as real as the wind to me. \n Regardless of my symptoms, here is where people usually flip shit. \n I believe Im seeing sights & sounds bleeding over from nearby parallel universes. I believe the sensation & lights I experience are the actual substance or edge of our world. During one particular unexplainable instance in my recent life, I thought I had woken up in a parallel world, as a multitude of things and people are different than 'before'. \n So, does anyone else have any similar feelings?

So I'd say I'm pretty experienced on the way this online dating thing works, however this post is regarding something more serious. \n I met this woman, my age, beautiful, I'm very attracted to her. We went on many dates together, mutual attraction, she insisted on taking it slow and I was willing to go as slow as she wanted because she meant that much to me. Eventually we make it official, we make love, all that good stuff. I like to give her presents and flowers and gentlemanly things like that. I can be a little old-fashioned that way. We spend a lot of time together, I've been staying at her place more than my own. We love sleeping next to each other. \n Now I should mention that while we get along like two peas in a pod, we handle our emotions very differently. I'm more of the type who wears his heart on his sleeve, while she's a little more closed-off and guarded. As she's become more comfortable with me that's changed for the better and she's more affectionate, almost a completely different person from when we first started dating. But she is who she is and she keeps her feelings close and that's fine with me. \n At this point we've been seeing each other for a little more than a month. Maybe a month and a half since we had our first date. I think I've fallen in love with her. Plain and simple. And I want to tell her. This morning when I left for work and kissed her goodbye while she was half-asleep, I almost said \"goodbye babe, I love you\". It was just instinct, ya know? Reflexes. But I stopped myself. I want to tell her, but I'm painfully aware that it's only been about a month. It might be off putting for me to say so at this point. So there's that part of me and then there's the part that's saying \"be honest with your feelings. Tell her. She needs to know how you feel. If she's not receptive then it is not meant to be\". But I'm also petrified at the possibility of her not saying anything at all, or just saying she doesn't feel the same. \n So please, give me some advice.

It's been helpful. I'm doing better everyday. \n I don't want to give my and my ex's age and stuff cause our situation was pretty special. So I'll leave that out. Oh, and English isn't my first language so please understand any mistakes. \n I was with him for a little more than a year when he had to leave my country. He had to go back for his job situation, and we decided to do long distance thing when he left. We had such a strong belief in our relationship, didn't doubt we'd have any problem other than missing each other so much. \n It was pretty tough, first of all we missed each other so much. We used to hangout almost every day after work, spent most weekends and holidays together. We didn't have much fight, we were perfect, we loved each other so much and we were both so special to each other. Those days were sweet.\nAnd things got harder once he started a new life and got some friends to hang out. We were pretty much all we had when we were in the same country, so I had a hard time accepting that. \nWhen he was where I was, I didn't mind him partying all night. I never bothered him with texts, or I would just party with him and his friends so I was there. We never had that problem, ever. But the situation was different. Because of the time difference, I started to freak out about him not texting me when he's partying. I don't know why, I just freaked out. I texted him so many times, called him constantly, sent empty threat texts. He would always say sorry when I did that, though he continued to do the same thing over and over. I was getting more paranoid about getting his text while he was out.\nAnd then I visited him, two weeks ago. 19 hours flight, I didn't mind. We spent such a great time together. We did what we missed, said I love you constantly, and in the end we had really sad airport goodbye. He seemed okay, he was just normal. It was the guy I fell in love with and loved the whole time we were together. \n After I came back home, a week passed without a problem. We were missing each other terribly, but already planning my next visit. We were excited about it and also I was planning to move to his area for school. He was so excited about it.\n And then it happened again. He went out drinking and lost contact almost 20 hrs straight. In the end his phone was off, I didn't know what to do. I was pretty convinced that something awful had happened. So when he texted me that he was okay just super hungover, I said the worst thing I had ever said to him so far. He kept saying sorry but I demanded that he should come back with a \"solution\" not an empty promise that he would break anytime soon, like \"I'm not going to do it ever again\". I was awful I know, I regret saying those.. We made up eventually. I decided that I'd just accept that it's something he can't really do, so from that moment I would not worry when he goes out drinking with his buddies, I was just gonna wait until the next day. \n He started to act weird. Well he would still answer my text and do facetime, but he seemed a little off. So a couple of days later I asked him what was wrong, and he said he felt a little distant from me since that day I got mad at him and now he was scared and worried about the whole future, not just the long distance thing but the whole thing we were planning to be together. I was shocked, I never expected this. He asked for a little space when I tried to ask more about his feelings, so I was going to give him some but I was already super heartbroken at that point. \n He still talked to me like he used to do. We texted good morning/night, talked during the day but I just could not have a normal conversation when I knew what he was thinking. I couldn't wait so I tried to talk to him about it if I had a slight chance, or asked him if he needed a break from talking. His answer was all \"I don't know\". I gave it a couple of more days. I tried to apologize so many times about me being crazy on him all those times, and tried to encourage him to be positive about the future. Didn't work. He was only getting worse. \n So yesterday morning, I broke it off. I know him very well, he was just suffering from all those thoughts and concerns, he couldn't ask my question \"do you still love me?\". That was more than enough, I decided to be the one who calls it quits and take his burden off. So I did it. It was hard, he still said he's not ready to break up with me and I wasn't either. But I didn't see any hopes when he said he didn't know how he felt about me anymore. \n It was a hard week. I accepted a little bit of it but it still seems unrealistic. I still think he was \"the one\" for me, still feel like I'm going to see him and especially, our past memory is killing me. I already broke down once and texted him to give me a second chance, but all he says is \"It's my fault, I had this thought even when you visited me but didn't talk about it. It grew in me and now I don't have strength to fight it. Long distance is hard and making me more and more sad, the thought about future is scaring me. I lost it\" \n I gave up, but it's still so hard. I don't think I can ever get over it. My world just collapsed a week ago. I still miss him, I still love him. [summary]: "}
{"input_text": "After not being able to get what I was after from Australian stores I just ordered a whole heap of gear from the states and canada, sent through two different freight forwarders. Given that there's a few old posts asking about this I thought I'd write something about my experiences. \n SHIPITO - I couldn't recommend these guys more. I ordered through Hockey Monkey and everything went smoothly. I had a couple questions about the package consolidation and their online customer service was great. Total postage cost with whatever they charge for consolidation (the order came in three boxes, Shipito got it all in one) for 3 sticks, a jersey, socks, laces, jock and a couple of other small things was USD $110 (AUD $150 at the moment). I think I processed the shipment on a Thursday and it was delivered to Sydney the following Tuesday. \n SHIPMATICA - Avoid these guys. I used them so I could order from The Hockey Shop in Canada who had really good deals on protective gear but won't ship to the states (Shipito only has warehouses in America). Shipmatica has a warehouse in Toronto and the postage calculator gave good rates. Firstly Shipmatica has hidden fees, to pay for any postage you need to transfer into your accounts 'wallet' which adds a 4.5% commission. When my gear got to the Toronto warehouse I was told that they don't actually use UPS from that warehouse which was quoted on the postage calculator (I believe they've removed this since), so I'd have to pay ~$100 extra to have it sent by Canada Post to Oregon then the same amount first quoted from Oregon to Aus, or $600 direct with Canada Post. I kicked up a stink about it and they eventually sent it to Oregon for free, but no one from Shipmatica customer service would reply to any of my emails trying to get answers about what was happening. Thankfully the guy working in the Canadian warehouse (I think the only person there) was relaying messages between me and their office, but it isn't the ideal way to deal with things. The company seems quite new so they could improve, but I'd stay away from them for now. [summary]: "}

But you will need to maintain a competitive average - it changes from year to year and will be based on your last 30 credits (regardless of what they are). If you want to transfer into 2nd year engineering directly, you have to have the equivalent of 27 credits of our 1st year program (found here:  - please note APSC 122 is a 0 credit presentation course to expose you to the programs here at UBC, so don't worry about that one).  If you don't have 27 credits of our 1st year program, you will be placed in 1st year, to make up the credits you are missing.  That means, you can go into Arts and transfer after a year - but only if you have good grades. You will have to consider what you will do, if you don't achieve a high average.\nAs for SFU - you can transfer after a year, but not directly into 2nd year.  They have a different syllabus and so you probably won't be taking the equivalent courses. That might mean that you will take courses there that won't count towards a UBC Engineering degree.  However, if you chose to stay there, then you could finish your degree there still (so it's still an option). \n If you are really keen to go into UBC Engineering, then Kwantlen or Langara might be your best bet.  There you can do the exact same 1st year program and transfer directly into 2nd year without losing any time and taking courses that won't directly relate to your degree.

We had a Moment.

{"input_text": "Today [This]( thread was made regarding me raging in a game. Normally I wouldn't want to publicize my drama but because there is an actual situation surrounding this plus it got quite a bit of attention I would like to address it. I don't want to just address this occasion though, I want to address raging in general. I'll start with this game though. \n \n Rant About The Game in That Thread  Skip this if you dislike drama. \n At the start of the game singed asks me if I'm going AP, I explain I am, he obviously didn't understand how it was viable but the game started out normally. I leash blue and head to lane. Around level 3 I get ganked by Maokai while laning against Jayce. They both use flash and get the kill because the both flashed. Right away Singed makes a sarcastic comment about how AP Rengar is viable. I ignore it and proceed back to lane where Mao never backed so when I went to ward he's still sitting in the bush and I die again (>.>). By now I'm naturally annoyed enough to want to AFK, however I don't afk. I am mad though. Singed makes another comment on it. I decide to just comment by saying that I can jungle and he can top if he wants (I know we won't actually switch though, I'm aware I'm still the top laner). A few minutes later Mao comes top again (through lane) and flashes to W me. Jayce flashes behind me and E's me into the wall and although I tried to run through tribush they kill me. Again two flashes and I died. I'm really annoyed at this point. Singed makes another comment. I ask him for a gank, I say that if I get a gank I can get some space and try to recover. Singed tells me that there is no point to gank because we won't be able to kill Jayce, even though he hasn't even tried and all I need is jayce damaged so I could farm (which I explain). Later Singed is getting blue and runs into river on a ward he saw Jayce place and I'm even pinging it and he doesn't get it so I tell him it's warded (rudely). Singed at this point doesn't like me, I have to back often because I'm behind and Jayce harass is insane and everytime I go back Singed goes into my lane and farms/pushes it, putting me further behind. I told him politely to stop pushing my lane first, he didn't, I raged at him. I managed to pick up a solid kill bot through a gank but the games over and I rage at singed a bit more because I was pissed off. \n I don't believe raging helps anybody but yourself. Raging calms me down, it keeps me from going AFK. If I want to tell somebody off who's being really annoying I will. Raging isn't good for winning, it will not help me win, in fact I never win when I rage. I only rage to make myself feel better. This game I believe the Singed deserved to be raged at and I would not undo that which is done, although I do regret the other three teammates who had to put up with us. Yes, some of the stuff I said was  a little harsh, the words I use represent my anger, I can rage using nice words if the person doesn't make me that mad. If I'm only minorly mad I'll just say \"Cmon Singed...\" or something like that, but it did feel like this singed was going out of his way to get me mad. I'm in the right to rage, I understand I risk being banned, I confirm a loss, etc. I rage when I feel the need. \n Also, I've been particularly annoyed for the past few days because the person you could basically call my mentor IRL passed away Wednesday morning, I've been very depressed and have been unable to focus. It's not an excuse, but it has attributed to my easily irritable state. \n \n A little information on raging and how to deal with it \n If you want somebody to play better raging at them is not the way to do it. Encourage them through whatever way possible and they'll play more professionally. Raging at somebody almost always makes them play worse in fact and you're probably already raging at them for playing badly, making everything worse. The same goes for trolling people, if somebody is doing badly and you troll them because of it by saying something like \"Maybe you should've let me play AD :P\" even if it's in a friendly sense it will annoy them and make them play worse. \n If somebody on your team is raging when they're doing bad it's generally a good idea to just ignore them. If you're doing bad that just means they don't know raging will make you play worse or they're so annoyed they don't give a  **  anymore. If they're doing badly though the reason they're raging is the same reason I rage, because I don't want to go AFK but I cannot take another 10 minutes of this. I need somebody to help me, or I need some way to get my anger/annoyance out of my system so I can play to my best. Lots of people are like this, if you just ignore them they'll keep typing and keep raging but it'll calm them down and probably make them play better. If you respond like a douche though (which is the average) it only makes them madder, more annoyed, and makes everything worse. \n Raging is not okay in any situation though. When I first started playing I got stuck at 900 elo, I raged almost every single game. I got better at controlling myself though and I started to be nice in 40%, 50%, 60% of my games, etc. Nowadays I rage in a good 10% of my games but I still rage in 10% of my games which isn't good.I'll generally rage over three possible things: 1. I'm on a losing streak and I have a particularly bad teammate. 2. Somebody on my team is trolling/being a douche. 3. I'm being camped to holy hell and my team refuses to help me. None of these situations are improved by raging, it just calms me down. I try to stay calm through these situations, they happen in my than 10% of my games, I still get annoyed and go off though in some. I try to help it but once it's begun I'm far too mad to get into a better mood unless through some weird coincidence my teammates hear my rage and use it positively which is rarely the case. \n The simplest way I've found to deal with raging is to ignore people. I have the Singed from that game on my ignore list. I ignored him a little late but once I realized he had just started trolling me (farming my lane) I did ignore him because before that I had hoped there was SOME chance he would help me out in lane. Another good way is to just afk for 10-20 seconds, breath, take a drink, and then play again. It doesn't put you that far behind and you can get ahold of your mind, I do this a lot because I'm very irritable and I need a way to control myself. \n \n Final Notes \n Raging is wrong. I will not apologize to the Singed for what I said simply because I believe he deserved it, I will apology to the other three teammates for having to listen to it, and I will apology to everybody who had to read what I said, I was very pissed off and my language was too the extreme because of it. I would like to ask that people not judge me from one bad game but it is each individuals choice to do as they please and if you wish to hate me, or anybody, for raging in one game that is your choice. I thank you for reading this and I'm sorry for the drama I've brought to the /r/LeagueofLegends board, I like reading content, I felt I had to address this but I also tried to put content in my post as well so that it would help others as much as it possibly can. \n If you want proof that I don't normally rage you can come watch me stream sometime on  twitch  for updates when I'm streaming, I generally stream 2-4 times a week during weekdays, and I hope I can prove to you that I'm not always this bad of a guy :P I like to do commentary and answer questions while streaming as well.

So here are some things that I've noticed/have happened and it would just be nice to have some sort of validation or to know if I am just being dramatic or imagining things: \n My mom makes me feel guilty any time I do something differently that she would. But at the same time she never directly says anything really hurtful or demeaning but it's always really subtle cues like if she's upset with something I did she'll ignore me for a few days or say \"oh that's nice.\" \n She constantly talks about my \"future husband\" and what she imagines him to be like and what she's going to do with my future kids. However, I have no interest in being married or having children, and she knows this. \n She'll tell me and my dad things that we've supposedly done or said and neither of us have any recollection of saying these things. For example: she once accused me of saying that all my friends have \"the best parents ever\" which \"made her feel terrible\" even though I never even mention my friends' parents to her in conversation. \n She says/does things and later denied them. When I was younger she once told me that she wished she could shake me to death but she couldn't because she would go to jail. I later asked her if she really meant that and she told me she had no idea why I would make up such awful things about her and that I must just think she is a terrible mother. \n Last spring she had a breakdown and threatened to commit suicide while screaming at me that I was selfish, ungrateful and judgmental. I calmed her down and apologized profusely and that same afternoon I came home from work and she was baking cookies like nothing ever happened. \n She'll also do little things like post comments on Facebook that are really negative. Example: a cousin posted a picture of Christmas cookies. My mom commented \"I used to bake cookies with my kids but they always bailed on me so I stopped.\" \n We never say \"I love you\" in our household or show any sort of affection (not even between parents). \n She watched hallmark movies and mentions that she wishes she could have a great family like the ones in those shows. \n She constantly talks about celebrities like they're her best friends. She loves Gwen Stefani's laugh, Adam Levine is just the sweetest guy ever and she likes how \"real\" Nicki Minaj is because she obviously knows these people on a personal level. Also example: one night at dinner she bragged to us that Eminem's daughter graduated as valedictorian or something. (I was sixth in my class) and I got upset and she made me feel guilty for overreacting and thinking she was a bad mom again. \n **raised me to believe my dad was abusive (used that term) and I just found out a couple months ago that everything she told me was a complete lie. My dad thinks she did it to make me love her more and create a wedge between him and I. \n I'm just really confused because I love my parents and I know they love me but something in our family just seems a little \"off.\" And I'm so grateful for everything they've done for me so I don't feel like I have a right to complain but at the same time  it gets really difficult sometimes to manage the stress that my mom causes me and I would really just like to know if I just need to get myself together or if there is actually a valid problem here. \n Also please excuse typos/formatting. I'm on lunch at work and on mobile. This has just been on my mind a lot and would really like some advice/guidance. I don't think I broke any sub rules but if I did I'm sorry and I'll fix it when I get on my computer! [summary]: "}

For starts there is a girl (22f) we can call her C, in my eyes she is true perfection tall blonde perfect body bright blue eyes. Anyways the way she looks is not as important as her personality i have never meshed with a girl so well her sense of humor is amazing we like the same music we have similar energy levels when it comes to hanging out. Anyways you get the picture im clearly head over heals for C she is nothing but an angel in my eyes. Like I said before my situation is unique cause well I am a pretty weird dude that has had some 'sexual issues'. I grew up in a nice part of a medium sized city on the westcoast, I was born 6 weeks premature and the doctor convinced my parents to not have me circumcised since I had been through allot with being born early and not being the healthiest baby.I developed something called phimosis which is where you have a tight foreskin and the head of your penis cannot come out. It makes sex very uncomfortable for most people or in my case impossible. I did not know I had the condition till middle school when I saw a porn and the actor was uncut and it showed him retracting his foreskin, being embarrassed I never said anything to pretty much anyone and refused to take off my pants during physicals. I was extremely awkward in highschool kind of a unpopular kid that made himself known as being the silly/crazy punk rock kid (old pictures are hilarious). I made out with a girl for the first time in 10th grade. The first time I tried to do more was with the same girl at 19 but I got to scared and said I couldn't cause I didnt want her to see my deformed ant eater looking dick. The first time a girl ever saw my dick was when I was 21 drunkenly fooled around with this girl she gave me the worst handjob ever and I couldnt keep it up because I was drunk. Drinking and drugs became a problem from a young age I smoked weed for the first time in middle school and started really partying hard at 21 after I started working in night/strip clubs. By 23 I was doing MDMA and cocaine regularly and working at a notorious cocaine ridden strip club. My drug use and partying escalated because it was the only way I knew how to feel close to girls was get fucked up with them. I avoided having sex like the plauge always making up excuses. At 24 I started becoming intimate with a girl that was my \"best friend\" we were also really fucked up drugs at the time and I was an alcoholic. Me and her tried to have sex many times but it never worked but I blamed my nerves and the drugs/booze for my ED I had trouble accepting that my dick was never going to work in its state of phimosis. At 25 I hit rock bottom on the drugs and alcohol and used my health insurance that I had from my dads job to check myself into a rehab center to detox off of what at this point was heroin. When I got out of rehab I was having some problems adjusting to life back in the city I was from and started to entertain the idea of moving somewhere else. I saved up some money and moved to NYC. NYC was awesome but a little to roudy for me so when an option came to move to the suburbs outside of washington DC I hopped on it. DC is where I live now currently I have  been here for about 7 months and for as much as I initially hated it I have grown to love this city. I met C when she worked at a night club I was  working at when I first moved here. Belive it or not our friendship started over talking about futurama and the band sublime. We would flirt allot at work but that was pretty typical for the girls that work at any night club to flirt with the bouncer. I wrote C's flirting off as nothing but a tease for a while until one night when I walked her out she kissed me on the mouth for the first time and texted me later saying she wanted to hang out. I couldn't believe it that this pretty girl liked me of all people, this girl that could literately date ANY guy she wanted was interested in an uneducated pothead (never went back to hard drugs) bouncer. The days before we hung out were the scariest days of my life especially when she brought up sex through texting and said she was a very sexual person and such. The first time she came over it blew my mind seeing her walk into the loby of my apartment building knowing that this girl wanted me but even more then excitement i felt fear cause I knew I could not give her what she wanted. We ended up fooling around some and i told her that I was really nervous and I had problems and there was no way I was going to be able to get it up that day cause i felt so nervous. She was understanding but asked allot of questions about my history and such. I sort of tried to down play the extent of my problem and up play how long my other relationship had lasted. After we hung out a couple times I told her about the phimosis and told her that it had to do with my ED. Well over the next month or so we grew pretty close hanging out once or twice a week usually for 12-18 hours. As I got comfortable with her my ED was cured but this only showed me how bad the phimosis was. I was able to get inside of her on several occasions but it was very painful for me. Finally I told her I was going to see a doctor and get it fixed and sure enough I was able to come up with the money and get it done only a few weeks later. I am currently waiting for it to heal I should have a perfectly functioning circumcised dick in a couple of weeks. I am pretty excited the surgery went well to say the least I have a normal looking dick for the first time in my life and it looks bigger then ever! C has been very supportive and often tells me about how great sex is going to be and how excited she is to let me explore myself sexually with her when I am healed. Me and her are not as she \nsays in a \"monogamous relationship\", this is not my favorite detail about us. It drives me up the fucking wall thinking about her hanging out with other guys although it is really none of my fucking business and I am just trying to take the good with the bad. She has done so much for me with convincing me to get my dick fixed and volunteering to have allot of sex and get myself up to speed with most guys my age when I am recovered. In some ways she has been like a sexual therapist I have talked with her about stuff I have never talked to anyone about and feel more comfortable around her then I ever through I would feel around a girl I was attracted to. I would be lying if I said there were not days it makes me cry and feel like shit when I picture her with other guys but she has made it clear that I am the only guy in her life that she sees a future with but the sexual shit needs to be under wraps before settling down is even an option.

{"input_text": "Throwaway account to avoid friends who know my account. \n My girlfriend (F23) and I (M22) are in a LDR with a 5 hour time difference, her being ahead. We both are currently working, and have been having a tough time with communication lately. My work is very flexible with texting throughout the day, and hers only allows her to use her phone rarely. By the time she gets off of work gets home, makes dinner, etc. we usually only have an hour or two to talk per day. This is not the first time that we\u2019ve had this issue, but feel that it might be worse at the moment because of the fact that we are both working full time. \n I am the kind of person who needs a lot of conversation, especially the more time it\u2019s been since we\u2019ve seen each other. She is the type of person who needs more conversation through things like Skype that feel more real to her, although Skype is not really possible other than the weekends due to our jobs. Texting is our main form of communication during the week, and this is not as important for her. She also struggles to spend all day on the computer and then come home and spend a lot of time on her phone texting. \n I feel like I am mostly the main driving force behind out conversations, and if I would stop asking questions/making conversation then we wouldn\u2019t talk at all. When the conversation starts to die down, instead of asking a question or proposing another topic, she will sometimes just use one word answers or not respond until I take it in a different direction or pick it back up again, and sometimes it feels to me like she is not that interested in having a conversation, but more responding out of obligation. Sometimes, when it\u2019s been a long time since she\u2019s been on her phone, she will just skip over a bunch of texts that I wrote earlier. \n The other thing that really bothers me sometimes is when it's been a long time since I've heard anything and I'll get online to send her a message or after she's said goodnight and I get on to talk to someone else, and I see that she's online/has been online recently. I definitely realize that I should not be checking to see the last time she's been online, but it makes me feel like the \"I don't want to spend as much time on my phone\" excuse is not the issue, or that she would rather talk to other people. I don't expect her not to talk to other people, or always prioritize me first, but the amount it happens makes me feel I'm taking a backseat. \n Sometimes when I get frustrated with things, I almost start to mimic her in ways, by being short with texts, and I'll set up almost like tests that I know she's going to fail. \"Let's see if I'm short and kill the conversation, will she pick it back up again?\" And stuff like that. I feel like this is a terrible way to go about things, and is only setting myself up to get more frustrated. She's noticed this in the past, and I completely understand why she hates it when I do this. She feels like I do this to hurt her on purpose, or to try and make her see how it makes me feel. This is not why I do it, I think it's mostly a justification thing for me, trying to prove that it's ok for me to be upset about this. \n Whenever we talk about it, she tells me that I should just be happy with the texting as it is and to look forward to skyping on the weekend. Sometimes, though I\u2019m not sure that it\u2019s enough. She is working on it, but she does not like it when I bring up the issue again, which is difficult for me when I feel like things are starting to regress again. \n A lot of times I feel like I am being too controlling and immature, and that this is all just my problem, but I can't seem to get over it sometimes.

{"input_text": "This theory also delves into the birth of Roxas, Sora's memories, and may mention Ventus a little as well. I have posted this theory as a comment in some other threads so you may have seen it before. \n Namine is Kairi's Nobody as we all know. She is a very special Nobody as when Kairi's heart did not turn into a Heartless as she is a Princess of Heart and her heart is devoid of any darkness that could turn into a Heartless. Her heart went and rested within Sora's heart. I guess Sora's heart seemed like a safe place to go. With her heart gone, but not manifested into a Heartless, her body (and soul) went into a comatose state. I guess this could speak to Kairi possibly not having an extremely strong will or it could be from the trauma of having her heart forced out of her body to evade the darkness. \n Let's move on to Namine's creation. She was created from Sora using the Keyblade of People's Hearts on himself to unlock his own heart which released his own heart which turned into a Heartless, Kairi's heart which revived Kairi, Ventus' heart is released, and since Sora and Kairi's hearts were released from a \"viable\" body, not one, but two Nobodies were created. These two Nobodies are Roxas, Sora's Nobody, and Namine. \n Now, a Nobody is created when a person has a strong enough will. I believe \"will\" to be part of the soul and heart and since Nobodies generally have souls, they can use the soul's will to manipulate the body. I also believe the soul is what holds one's memories. There are some exceptions to this such as Xehanort's Heartless and Sora although I believe the fact they released their own hearts is the reason for this. Back to Nobody's memories, people with very strong hearts whether dark or light will be able to keep their memories as a Nobody. If Nobodies don't have heart then where are the memories stored? The body or the soul? I honestly don't have a good answer to this as this is where my theory starts, but I believe it would it would be the soul. \n Let's jump to Roxas for a moment. When he was born, he is devoid of any kind of life, thought, or \"emotion.\" He is Sora's Nobody so he should have Sora's body, soul, and memories and look like Sora, right? Let's start off with his appearance because its an easy explanation that everyone knows. Roxas more than likely had Ven's heart as it would seem the heart shapes the vessel especially in the case where the vessel doesn't have a heart (at least currently). Next up is Sora's body which Roxas has half. Yes, Roxas has half of Sora's body and the rest of the vessel created itself through light and darkness. The other half of the body is what created Namine which would also be filled in as well. Lastly, Sora's soul which is where I believe his memories would be is not with Roxas, but is instead with Namine. This would explain a few things in relation to both Roxas and Namine. Roxas is born without a soul and has a sleeping heart within him which is why he appears very lifeless during his first few days as he \"generating\" no will. We don't have any confirmation on how quickly hearts grow so either they grow quicker than we think or Roxas' grows quicker for some reason. Maybe life and the experiences he begins to have especially with Axel, and later Xion, have a much larger impact on someone like him who has no heart or memories to look back on. Maybe life is much brighter to someone like Roxas who pretty much knows nothing of the world and maybe that shaped his heart much quicker than others. Interestingly, Xion, who has no memories either, grows a sense of self extremely quickly as well which could be a relation to her growing a heart very quickly as opposed to another Replica, the Riku Replica, who doesn't grow a sense of self until Namine shatters his memories. In a sense, they are both infants to the world. Getting back on track here, maybe Roxas' heart grew very quickly which allowed him to \"generate\" will for himself, but still have no memory since he doesn't have Sora's soul and still look a lot like Ven since he has Ven's heart. \n What does this say about Namine? Well, we don't know what kind of state Namine was born in, but by the time we all first see her in Chain of Memories; she seems active. Reserved, but active in her thoughts and \"emotions.\" Whether or not she acted lifeless like Roxas I believe is unknown, but I would wager she didn't because like I said I believe she has Sora's soul and would therefore be born with will and life. If my thoughts on souls and memory are correct then the fact that Namine can control the memories of Sora seems to fall into place. Add that to the fact that part of her creation is from a Princess of Heart, one who is very close to Sora I might add, and we could draw assumptions as to why she would have such a powerful ability. Princess of Heart \"magic/pure light\" and Sora's memories allow Namine to control and manipulate Sora's memory and memories of Sora. \nHer appearance isn't that of Sora or Kairi. I don't have a good answer for this, but I do have one nonetheless. Roxas got half of Sora's body and it was filled in with light and darkness. I was already pushing the boundaries on good explantions with that one, but I believe Namine's did the same, but only filled in with light as she is the Nobody of a Princess of Heart (she might have even taken some of Kairi's light which is why Kairi needed Namine back to be truly whole again). This could attribute to why she has such a \"pure\" appearance (blonde hair, blue eyes, pale complexion, all white clothing, and very simple clothing). Nomura has said that nothing is coincidence in Kingdom Hearts.\nHer personality is somewhat of an oddity. It could be attributed to how kind both Sora and Kairi are yet both Sora and Kairi are easily excited and strong willed characters where as Namine is quite reserved in her actions. This could be because she is a Nobody, who wouldn't feel emotions as strongly as a person would, mixed with her special relationship to Sora's memories and Kairi, but not actually being Sora or Kairi creating somewhat of an identity crisis which leads her to being a bit of an introvert and different person from either of them. This could explain why she doesn't act like Sora even though she has his memories and could replicate his emotions and personality as her own like a normal Nobody would. \n Lastly, in a way, Namine could be kind of a Nobody of both Kairi AND Sora, and Roxas could be an \"incomplete\" Nobody. And it has been said that they are both very special Nobodies so I wouldn't wipe this theory off the table. Also, for all you Sora-Kairi shippers, if Namine has Sora's soul and half of his body then the only way for him be whole is when he is around Kairi. [summary]: "}

Everyone buys a machine with equivalent clock speed/memory/hdd. That may be new or used, but Apple computers hold their value best; if the trio favour used machines the Apple aficionado will probably still pay the most. \n In light of that, the cost of the software is intimately wrapped up with the cost of the hardware. There is a development cost behind any operating system. \n Windows has a high price tag because they are primarily a software company(though they have lightly branched into mice, keyboards and web cams). Apple can subsume their software development cost into the computer itself; they are a hardware company and always have been. \n Strangely, without dumpster diving, Linux is not the cheapest.

{"input_text": "DISCLAIMER: I have had anxiety and depression my whole life. I have 2 children 3 and 1 and have been with my boyfriend since 2010. \n Even before we had children, I questioned the relationship with my boyfriend 'Bruce' a few times. When I first got with him, I was a very passionate individual with a lot of hobbies and interests. I also was quite unwell with anxiety after recently being in a relationship before Bruce with an alcoholic. \n Bruce is very different to me. He has few hobbies and is pretty much passionate about nothing. But he is a very loyal individual and he's very steadfast. My whole life I'd been in passionate relationships that made me ill, so when I met Bruce he was like a breath of fresh air. \n He was my Batman. The boyfriend I deserved. Someone to balance my passionate ways and keep me steady. And that was true for a long time. I got much better, I did well at my career, we got a house together, I finally have become an adult after such a long time struggling to find purpose in life. \n Our kids are amazing. I won't go into detail about them, but they are the best thing in my life and there's nothing I can write to fully describe how much I love them. They also love their daddy very very much and he is definitely the favourite parent with them. \n It was there from the beginning I suppose. Our sex drives never matched and I wanted it more than he did. So I ended up having to forgo what I wanted and to wait until he did. A few times I found out that he'd be too tired to do things with me because he'd been watching porn. I told him he could watch porn but it not be instead of sleeping with me. If he watches it now, he's good at hiding it, but our sex lives has gone from a few times a week to so far this year, a few times a year. \n Especially since our second child, our relationship has got so much worse. We are always tired from being up with the kids. They don't sleep well. I work part time self employed and so I'm either working or with the kids. He works full time and both of us are tired. He doesn't do anything around the house (which is in a constant mess) but he's amazing with the boys. He's an incredible father and he puts 100% into work and the kids, but that leaves nothing for me. \n And whatever was left now goes into a Marvel Fighting game on his phone. He spends literally every free moment that's not the kids or work, on his phone playing this game. My understanding is that he's got some kind of position in the clan and so has responsibility there. But it borders on insane the amount of time he spends on it. I don't want to ban him from doing anything, but it's just too much for me. \n We are so distant now and so tired that I can't really see the point of me staying in the relationship other than having someone help me out with the kids. \n Once or twice a month I tell him how I feel or how it's upsetting me or how distant we are or that we never sleep together and he just doesn't say anything. He just doesn't open up. And even though he acknowledges he's on the game all the time, he does nothing at all to lessen the time he plays it. \n I can't seem to snap him out of whatever this is. It just gets worse and worse and I don't know what to do. \n Equally, I've got from being upset to starting not to care. Which I realise is a red flag for our relationship, but I haven't got a clue how to reverse this apathy and close the distance. \n I am so close to giving us a deadline or an ultimatum and if things don't improve then tellin him it's over. But then I find it so hard having anxiety and depression to tell whether I feel this way because of my anxiety and depression. \n I guess I'm writing all this out and asking for your opinions because I feel like I can't trust my own. \n I do have to add before I finish this that I have gained weight since having my children which I'm actively trying to lose, but it makes me feel disgusted with myself. So whilst previously I was asking for sex a lot, I've now stopped altogether because I don't feel good about myself. I am definitely trying my best to remedy this situation. \n I also contracted hypothyroidism after the birth of our first child and I struggle with that daily and it does make it harder to lose weight and can worsen anxiety and depression. \n Please can someone just give me some direction. I feel so lost right now. Thank you. [summary]: "}

{"input_text": "Hey guys, my first post here after lurking for a while. I followed done of the steps here but I managed to have an amazing date last saturday just out of the blue. So here's the full story. \n A few years ago I liked this girl I met through some friends, she was funny and we would talk for hours. Being the young love struck boy I was, I didn't realize that she was a complete drama queen who didn't give a damn about me, and that did come back to bite. Eventually I figured it out and was furious, but it'd be a year and a move across the works for me to admit it to her.

{"input_text": "You seem ignorant about the resources needed for a replay system. \n Riot has said previously that implementation of replays requires a better server network, which is true. Replays, particularly if they are kept for long periods of time, would take up a lot of storage for League, which isthe most played international game in the world. \n Riots current server system is lacking because they had absolutely no expectation of their game getting this big. At this point they could just keep renting larger and larger servers, but that's a vicious cycle of continuing to switch to better servers and transferring data between them whenever they do. The only reasonable option that gives a chance at a stable and successful future is to do what every other major online game does and buy/make their own servers, which is not an easy process. \n It's not that technology hasn't caught up to League, that's ridiculous, it's that Riot lacks the infrastructure to support the largest mmo in the world as a developer that is less than a decade old. \n Saying that League should have Replays because Broodwar had them in 2003 is disingenuous. In 2003, Blizzard had already been developing for 12 years, and had made millions in sales from Warcraft, Warcraft 2, and Diablo. They had success and resources to make the infrastructure  beforehand , whole Riot didn't have that luxury and now has to play catch up. \n Also the client is shit for the same reason and likely needs to be overhauled before Replays are a thing.

{"input_text": "Reddit I am wondering what is the best course of action is to save my job. \n \n Back story:   I started my job July 21st. Job title of program director at a private martial arts school. The position entails marketing and student retention efforts, special event coordination, management of current and incoming memberships, business statistic evaluation and basic office organization. I have felt that I have been doing well, and gaining new business rapidly. (More so than they were doing before I came.) I have spoken with them regarding my progress and any possible improvements I could make. The only downfalls they have mentioned are that I use names instead of titles more often than I should (such as, Brad vs Sir, or Andrew vs Sensei.. A martial arts culture thing..), and that I could be more friendly and less professional on the phone (they want it to feel more like a conversation.) I am a smoker as well, and have received negative feedback from this. These are all things that I have been working on, and in my opinion have been quickly improving. I arrive early and stay late 90% of the time, often even after clocking out, not to mention the work I take home. \nMy employer has asked me to attend the classes we offer, while unpaid, in order to familiarize myself with the product. I make classes as often as possible when work or other responsibilities do not interfere. I realize here there is room for improvement, as far as I know my job security is unaffected by this. \nAs a smoker, I fully understand that the smell of the smoke is unattractive and I have been doing my best to eliminate this problem. Furthermore I have  never  asked for a smoke break, nor do I associate myself with smoking at work in any way other than the problem above. \n \n The Problem: \nMy boyfriend and I were looking on Craigslist for any new job openings he might be interested in. In doing so we stumbled on a rather upsetting post, my job. It was the exact post I had applied to just four months earlier. The job is dated September 21st. Now I am unsure of where I stand. I would like to address this immediately but would like to go about it in the most professional and clear headed way possible. The options I see this far are: I could call my boss asap, wait to talk to him in person, or silently wait while soaking up the remaining hours. If I plan to bring this straight to my boss, I feel that talking to him on the phone or to my manager would give him time to prepare. I would like to catch him off guard if possible. \n So you can see my problem now.. Please reddit. What the fuck would you do!!!????? [summary]: "}
{"input_text": "Been thinking about this frequently and Ben Brode's latest Q&A prompted me to post my idea: \n The basic deck page (with the one pre-built deck for each class) will remain the same. \n The custom deck page will still have 9 slots, but these slots will each represent one of the 9 classes, instead of an individual deck. New players who just finished the tutorial will see the mage class character in the first slot, while the 8 other slots will be empty. With each class they unlock, the remaining slots will be populated with those classes. \n When the user clicks one of the classes for the first time (on the custom deck page) it will take them into the deck builder. So initially, new players will be able to have ONLY ONE custom deck per class. However, every 5 levels the player earns with a specific class opens up a new deck slot for that class. For example, when a new user reaches level 5 with their Rogue class, they will click the rogue icon on the custom deck screen and it will give them a list of 2 deck slots to choose from, allowing them up to 2 rogue decks. \n This way, the screen is not cluttered with loads of empty deck slots. It keeps decks organized by class, is easy to navigate, and allows users to unlock more deck slots for the classes they are actually playing. \n Cons: it takes one extra click to get to a specific deck (pick class, then select deck).

{"input_text": "My fiance (Jane) and I became friends with a married couple several months ago, Karl and Carla (not real names). Since then we have hung out together a half dozen times, including going on trips out of town with them and other mutual friends. We are all very similar people and get along great, our mutual friends have all commented about how Jane and Carla are so much alike, and Karl and I have a huge amount in common. We all seem to click with each other at a deep level. It's like we've known each other forever even though we only just met earlier this year. Where things get confusing is that I've been noticing things, or think I have been, which make me suspect there is some kind of sexual tension going on. For one, Jane's libido has skyrocketed since we became friends with them. There are other factors involved, but especially when we hang out with them, we pretty much always have wild sex afterwards. It's become a noticeable pattern at this point, and seemed especially obvious on the trip we last went on with them (Jane got very drunk and was more enthusiastic than I'd ever seen her). After recognizing this pattern I started noticing a few other things: \n Jane gives Carla very physical hugs. At one point on our recent trip I looked over and Jane was hugging Carla in a way that pressed her breasts in Carla's face while one arm was between Carla's breasts. They held on to each other very tightly and quite a bit longer than a normal hug, it didn't exactly seem sexual or sensual in context but there was a lot of contact between them and they appeared to both be enjoying it quite a bit (this happened in front of everyone so it's not like they were trying to hide anything or were acting guilty about it). We all hug each other when we first get together and before we separate after so it's not like hugging is unusual for us but there have been a few times now where Jane's hugging has looked \"passionate\" if that makes any sense. \n Carla subtly touches me. It's never been anything that seemed sexual or inappropriate but I've noticed a few occasions now where we've been siting closely and a foot or arm will end up against me. One time when we were drunk and sitting on a floor she very blatantly pressed her feet and legs against me for awhile, her feet were basically on top of my legs and almost resting in my lap. Another time I was sitting on the couch and she was sitting next to me on the ground with her foot obviously against mine, Karl saw it and made a face of some kind at her. I couldn't see his face but she didn't move her foot afterward so I'm not sure what that was about but it gave the impression her foot touching mine was not an accident and Karl was both aware and accepting. \n Karl seems comfortable touching me. I haven't picked up on him trying to touch me but most guys when you share an armrest with them will move away when your arms are touching each other. It only happened once, and he could legitimately say the same thing about me since I intentionally left my arm there to see how he would react, but he was fine just resting his arm against mine. I don't think there is anything wrong with that but in the context of other things I've been noticing I suspect it might mean something. \n I'm not sure what my question is here exactly but I am very confused about what's happening. Could I be imagining all this? Am I just misinterpreting normal human behaviors? It's all pretty subtle and minor stuff but it is starting to feel like they might be into some kind of non-monogamy thing and are feeling us out. I'm not sure what, if anything, I should do. \n Random other things that are possibly relevant:\nAs far as I can tell Karl and Carla are very happy together and have a healthy marriage. Jane is very happy with me, I know she finds women attractive but she has never been with one and considers herself hetero, and she's never said anything about finding Carla sexy. I believe she and Karl find each other attractive, and I've never seen them behave inappropriately or any kind of unwarranted touching between them. Jane's sexual fantasies often revolve around group sex but she has said in the past she has no interest in actually trying those kinds of things, we have a monogamous relationship. [summary]: "}

Within a week of giving him space after he received the order, he said he was in love with someone new, insulted me very badly and erased me from his life despite a week before saying he'd take a bullet for me.

{"input_text": "Every year, my family and I go to Turkey during the summer. When I was 10 or 11, we went, as usual, to a beach in Turkey for a holiday. Well, one day I was playing around on the pier on my own. When I say on my own, I mean my family were chilling out on the beach doing their own thing. There were other families and children playing on the pier also. \n So, basically, I decided it would be a good idea to set myself a little challenge. I wanted to see how far I could swim, underwater, from the pier. I ran off the end of the pier, dived into the water, and swam as far forward as I could before running out of breath. I prolonged the time I spent underwater as much as I could, so, needless to say that, when I came up for air, I really needed. I broke the surface, and opened my mouth wide to inhale deeply. Just as a wave crashed into my face. \n The curious thing about inhaling water, is that I've never heard anyone mention how it completely deadens your body. My limbs felt like dead weight, and I started going back down. Being at the bottom of the sea (it wasn't hugely deep), with a lungful of water, and not one of the people you know and love being aware of what's happening, was sufficiently terrifying for someone who had not reached their teens. \n I count myself unbelievably that I did not die; because, then and there, I was met with a circumstance in which I justifiably could have. Of course, I didn't just completely give up there - I was in terror for my life, so I tried desperately to scrape myself back towards the pier. I can only assume the currents of the sea aided me here, because, somehow, I made it back to the pier. \n The pier itself had a wooden staircase at the tip, that allowed people to easily get back onto it. \n I somehow managed to reach it, and drag myself out of the water. I laid on that staircase, completely limp, save for the coughing and retching, for at least a quarter of an hour, while my body tried to recover. That was a horrible experience...

If people report someone and it turns out to be unvalidated, like the person did do all those things but was still reported, the reporter will be put into low priority for x games.

The items can have passive effects, like a life steal or a slow effect, or they can have a use effect, like the teleport when using Portal Key. Note that some effects will not work together - these are called ATTACK MODIFIERS, and they do not stack. If you have two items with different attack mods on them, only one will be active at any one time (you can chose which one by clicking on it's symbol above the minimap) - it is generally a bad idea to get two, so avoiding this will save you a lot of abuse from your team. You should be safe from this provided you follow the recommended item guides in the shop. \n It will become more apparent to you which items work well with which heroes once you get more experience, so following a guide is a good idea until you are comfortable that you know what you're doing with item builds. \n Stats on items basically work to improve a range of things about your hero, particularly your health, mana, armour and attack speed. Each hero has a main stat (you can see this by their position in the picking phase), either INTelligence, STRength, or AGIlity. Increasing this main stat on a hero will increase their attack damage (quoted in tooltips as BASE DAMAGE). \n AGI - Increases Armor and Attack speed\nSTR - Increases HP and HP regeneration\nINT - Increased Max Mana and Mana regen. \n An item that requires some understanding of these stats is steamboots. They can be cycled through giving bonuses to a single stat by clicking on them. Usually you will have them on strength (red) for the health bonus, so you don't die so easily. They can be changed to int (blue) for the mana if you are casting lots of spells (be careful though, because this will mean you lose the hp bonus from having them on strength mode). Generally agi mode (green) is only used on agility heroes because it gives them good damage. Don't get too concerned with this right now, my suggestion is to keep them on strength (red) and leave them there until you become more comfortable with the game. \n Sometimes you will be attacking a player, or be being attacked by them, and you will notice that you are either doing very little damage to them, or that they are doing huge amounts to you, even though you are similar levels. This is probably because of either a specific mechanic they are using to do with the hero, or just because they have more/better items than you. It's a good idea to pick a few heroes to get good at and to read the tooltips for the items you are recommended to build on them. \n Note that items that have +X DAMAGE on them increase bonus damage, but do not contribute to BASE damage. This is important for effects that increase your base damage (like a double damage rune) and not your bonus damage. Most of the auras that increase damage will only affect base damage. Don't worry too much about this, it's only important in some items and on some heroes, and if it's too confusing then just ignore it for now :) [summary]: "}
{"input_text": "I think everyone needs to step back a little when it comes to suboptimal choices and consider this: \n \n It's completely fine to do something even if it's weaker than another option.

I pointed out Ice Shot would be much better, almost no matter what. He proceeded to argue against it by pointing out stuff like \"quality on lightning arrow is shock duration, so it's better\". Except it's not because more damage also means a longer shock duration, and Ice Shot's higher damage is as if every enemy comes pre-shocked, and more on top of that. \n I was then shot down. \"Hey, everyone can do what they want, stop forcing ice shot onto him\". \n That's not the point. I don't have anything against someone wanting to do something for the explicit reason of doing it as long as you  know  the other options.

After pleading for the Triads to spare Hinn's life The Triad boss Ming offers a deal to the two brothers. Steal all the listed cars and deliver them to Triad associates before a deadline hits or suffer a brutal death for all involved should they fail. They have a handful days to collect all vehicles. \n Mission 1 \u2013 Pink Slips 2 to 4 players \n Los Santos' renowned street racer Andrew \u201cThe Weasel\u201d says he'll give his car up to anyone who can beat him. The race he's competing in has a upstart racer with a brand new Dinka Sarakin, the only one to reach American shores. He's hoping to take this vehicle but we know better.  Make sure one player crosses the line first and take his heavily modified Obey 9F and in the confusion of the heat of the race steal the Sarakin before anyone realises what's going on. Stash both vehicles back at the airport LSC once you're done. \n \u2022The racer must come first.\n\u2022The Sarakin must be forced into last place and be stolen out of view of the other racers.\n\u2022The mission will be failed if the players cause any deaths. \n Completing this mission opens the Dinka Sarakin for purchase.

Take his place and steal the 4 cars the Triads want. The Benefactor Surano, The Dewbauchee Rapid, the Enus Huntley and the Albany Manana all need to be jacked. Stash them at the drop off and get back to the front desk as soon as possible, if a car turns up and nobody is there to take it you'll blow your cover and all this is over. You need to deal with every car that pulls up even if we're not here to steal them, so don't screw up.

I don't know why Ming want these and frankly I don't care. What you need to do is steal some planes from McKenzie Airfield, get up nice and high and parachute into the marked zone. Once you land sneak up on the vehicles and snatch them. Stow them away in Sandy Shores once you've escaped the police. If you screw the approach up you'll spook the people there and they'll make a run for it, if this happens you can use the off-road vehicles I've stashed up there for you. I wouldn't want to do that myself though, those babies wheels are taller than I am. \n \u2022Steal and deliver all marked vehicles.\n\u2022If a marked vehicle is destroyed the mission is failed. \n Completing this mission opens the Vapid Sasquatch, a variant of the monster trucks in game that's small enough to be kept in your personal garage. \n Mission 4 \u2013 Racing Stripes 4 players \n The USA Touring Car Race has come to Los Santos. I'm guessing these cars are going to end up in private collectors hands after you steal them. These cars are so expensive that they've got Merryweather in on the job protecting them. There's two Titans each with 2 cars in the back of each plane. The Sprunk Buffalo, the Massacro Racecar, the Dinka Jester Racecar and the Benefactor Feltzer Racecar must be stolen from Los Santos International Airport.

That's the bad news. The good news is that we've triangulated where they are and it appears they're in multi story car parks around LS. I've had a wannabe hacker knock up and app for your phone, when you ring the telematic number it'll flash the lights and beep the horn of the car so you can locate it. Get out there, find those cars and deliver them to the carpark up near the Boulevard. We'll take car of the rest. \n \u2022Deliver the cars marked by the app.\n\u2022If a vehicle is destroyed the mission is failed. \n Mission 6 \u2013 The Cursed Car 1 to 4 players \n This Voodoo was the first big purchase back in the 60's by the first Liberty City Triad Boss Po, he got it within 8 months of joining the American dream without being able to speak a word of English. It was seen as a significant coup for the Triads to be buying such lavish possessions off criminal activity after such a short time. Unfortunately it was stolen from Po after a deal went south and was passed about by rival gangs wanting to rub the Liberty City Triads noses in it. Ming wants it back and your orders are to go to a meeting and deal with the Aztecas and the Lost using it as a bartering chip over a deal over by the Lighthouse in Blaine.

In the World! 1 to 3 players \n Those British TV car show presenters are in LS testing out some high end vehicles for their TV show. I love these guys so this is hard for me to say, but we have to rip them off, what Ming wants Ming gets. Mask up and steal their cars but under no circumstances hurt them or their camera crews. It's already bad enough we're doing this but hurting them is something I don't want on my conscious. \n \u2022Steal the Pegassi Vacca from Sparkson. This gentlemen is known to be super aggressive so be ready for a fist fight.\n\u2022Steal the Pfister Comet from Beefmond. This gentleman is know for driving extremely dangerously without care for himself or other drivers so be ready for a chase.\n\u2022Steal the Ubermacht Zion from June.

One of the main owners of Bleeter has an enormous yacht anchored down just outside the Bluffs. It's not that that Ming is interested in though. On board there's a super rare coup\u00e9 called the Coil Mantaray that's only given to the worlds most high flyers. So how do you get this car back on dry land if there's no road to drive on? You sail it. That wondrous bit of technology is water tight and can propel itself underwater. Get to the yacht, take out the security and yank the Mantaray. Stay submerged until you lose the police and then bring it to the surface on Vespucci Beach. \n \u2022Gain access to the yacht and deal with the security. Killing innocents will bring more police in, so avoid it if possible.\n\u2022Do not damage the Coil Mantaray significantly. If you break any windows or bust any panels it won't remain water tight and will damage upon entering the water. A flooded car will result in a mission failure. \n Completing this mission will unlock the Coil Mantaray for purchase, it is styled on the Lotus Esprit. The Coil Mantaray has average performance for a coupe, but it has reinforced bodywork and windscreens to cope with the high pressures of being underwater. Players can ride on the surface of bodies of water by driving into them or they can hold right on the dpad to submerge. While underwater the vehicle controls like an airplane, albeit very slow. \n Mission 9 \u2013 Music Was Better Back Then 4 players \n Can't say I care for the 80's, 90's or even the 00's bands. Live in the here and now I say, unless we're talking about cars. Since we've got these has been bands on these reunion tours there's bound to be cars these rich coked up assholes have that are on Ming's list. Go to Vinewood Hills, get to the open air stadium, get past the entourages and boost some of those classic wheels. Try to avoid casualties, we don't need any more heat than we're already going to get for jacking these marks. \n \u2022Steal the Grotti Cheetah 80's\n\u2022Steal the Obey Deluxo 80's\n\u2022Steal the Pegassi Infernus 80's\n\u2022Steal the Bravado Banshee 80's\n\u2022Deliver all vehicles to the Terminal. If any vehicles are destroyed the mission is failed. \n Completing this mission opens up The Grotti Cheetah 80's, the Obey Deluxo 80's, the Pegassi Infernus 80's and the Bravado Banshee 80's for purchase. All cars are modelled similarly to what they were based on in Vice City. \n Mission 10 \u2013 The Sheik 4 players \n The Sheik of one of those oil rich countries is in town down at the Casino. He's renowned for being indecisive so has a trailer full of  his super cars follow him around so he can pick and choose what he drives no matter where he is. You're going to split into teams of a driver, a shotgun and 2 hackers. The driver and the shotgun go to the casino and fight to take control of the 18 wheeler carrying the goods while the hackers track down secret documents detailing police force telematic numbers. Once the driver is on the freeway that drives through the Tatavian Mountains the hackers have to work as quickly as possible to reduce the wanted level of the driver to zero before they hit Paleto Bay. Instead of only having one option on the rotating cylinders that spell out a word, there's several colours that all have a different effect on the police chasing the truck. You can cut engines, jam the accelerator on, gimp the steering or blast the cops with loud music to prevent them from running the truck off the road. \n Team 1 of driver and shotgun\n\u2022Fight your way through security and safely steal the vehicle carrier.\n\u2022Get it on the highway and deliver the load to Paleto Bay.\n\u2022If you take too much damage the load comes undone and the mission is failed.\nTeam 2 hackers\n\u2022Track down the van carrying the telematic data of police vehicles.\n\u2022Take the van to a safe place.\n\u2022Hack police vehicles until the star wanted is gone. If the truck uncouples or reaches its destination before the wanted is clear the mission is failed.\n\u2022If you destroy the van carrying the documents the mission is failed. \n Mission 11 \u2013 Cutting it Fine 2 to 4 players \n The last cars on the list, finally. If this whole things couldn't get any messier it appears that the Koreans and the Los Santos Triads are going to cost us our lives at the last hurdle. It looks like Ming might have cut them in on the list so they're fighting over a Pegassi Zentorno and a Truffade Adder we need. The stubbornness between the gangs means that if one can't have it then neither can have it. On top of this we've pretty much pissed every other gang off in LS and Blaine so expect them to give you hassle if you come into contact. Get out there, save those vehicles and come back alive. We didn't come this far to fuck it up. \n \u2022Each car has a timer and a health bar relative to the cars health. If either the timer or the health bar gets to zero before the vehicles are delivered to Rockford Hills LSC the mission is failed. \n Mission 12 \u2013 Mr Ming 2 to 4 players \n This is it. We go down to the Terminal and present the cars to Mr Ming himself. Here's hoping all the hard work we put in makes him have mercy on me and my brother Hinn. \n \u2022Drive down to the Terminal with Hao and Hinn and present the cars to Ming. \n Ming steps out of his Armoured Limo and inspects the wares before dropping the bomb. Ming Jr is still alive and set Hinn up because he kept beating him in the illegal races they'd participated in and as a result was in massive debt and brought great shame on the family. Just before they (the crew) decide to run waves of enemies made upon stealing the scores of cars the crew are stuck between a rock and a hard place. \n \u2022Survive the waves of enemies until a further plan is hatched\n\u2022Force Ming and Ming Jr back into the Armoured Limo by keeping them under heavy fire.\n\u2022Take a picture the the Armoured Limos license plate.\n\u2022Survive more waves of enemies until the telematic data can be found.\n\u2022Use the cellphone app to lock the Ming's in the back of the Armoured Limo.\n\u2022Steal the Armoured Limo and take it to Davis Quartz Quarry.\n\u2022On the drive to the Quarry, note that even explosions cannot destroy the Armoured Limo.\n\u2022Defend against the final waves while hiding behind the Armoured Limo.\n\u2022Use the Cutter that's used for mining the walls of the quarry to rip through the Armoured Limos defence and get revenge on the Ming's. \n Completing this mission unlocks the Armoured Limo, a heavily armoured version of the Dundreary Stretch that is impervious to pretty much anything you can throw at it. Performance is awful and it's impossible to shoot from the windows whilst riding in it to balance it out from being too powerful. \n New Cars\nDinka Sarakin\nVapid Sasquatch\nBenefactor Feltzer Racecar\nCoil Mantaray\nGrotti Cheetah 80's\nObey Deluxo 80's\nPegassi Infernus 80's\nBravado Banshee 80's\nArmoured Limo \n New Weapons\nKatana Blade \n Thanks for taking time to read this.

I now understand so many posts about how this game can make others seem dull and uninspired. I beat every boss except ebitrias, never found that thing.  And I played the whole game solo.  Finished up at level 70 which was higher than I intended but had to do something with the echoes I had.  So here's the question. Although I have started NG+ and I plan on going through all the chalices I'm curious if I should go and play the dark souls games.  I believe I have them for my CPU so I might load them up, or just buy them for my PS3 as that seems to be the better system to play them on since they were ported. \n Should I just buy DS2 for PS4?  Or is the first DS a truly better experience than DS2? I hear conflicted reports about the sequal so I'm kinda curious what makes either one better. [summary]: "}

{"input_text": "I was actually diagnosed IBS-C, but self-diagnosed PI due to it starting immediately after recovering from a massive stomach bug. That being said, I'd take this with a bit of a grain of salt. \n Even though there's not one tried-and-true answer on the path to recovery, everything I've read has discussed getting as much good bacteria back in your gut as possible. Here's what's worked for me so far: \n Probiotics :\nI was skeptical on these at first, but after being on a regimen of them for approximately 7 months, I've noticed a dramatic improvement. I recommend either  Garden of Life Primal Defense  or  Align . You can find  GoL  at Whole Foods/online and  Align  at most groceries/online. \n Dietary Changes :\nAs someone who was a super picky eater that would eat plain cheeseburgers and the same 5 meals every week, this was the toughest for me. I tried elimination and FODMAP diets, but they didn't work for me because they were so tough to follow. I, essentially, had to eliminate all foods from my diet because I ate so few things. Also, finding the specific foods at the grocery was so difficult that I would get immensely frustrated and give up. \n I switched over to doing all organic veggies and fruits (which took a little testing to figure out which of these didn't cause issues) to remove any GMOs, etc, from my diet. Grass-fed, lean meats and cage-free, lean chicken seem to help since there is less fat in my diet. I don't cut out gluten. Instead, I get more ancient wheats such as spelt, einkorn, and kamut. They have fewer chromosomes and do less damage to your system. And you can find most of these at Whole Foods or online for cheap. Most wheats constipate me and cause me to bloat up horribly, but these don't. I recommend kamut wheat pasta as it seems to have the most similar consistency to what you get at the store. \n Usually eating these kinds of foods cost more, but if you do a bit of research first, you can find some very decent prices. I've never done so much grocery shopping online before recently. \n Fluids :\nDrink lots of fluids every day. Fluids help your gut recreate good bacteria. They work hand-in-hand with the probiotics, too. Water, coconut water, and Gatorade are my go-tos. Days where I don't drink a lot, I feel way worse. \n Peppermint Oil :\nI take peppermint oil tablets whenever I have the now-rare flare-up. They really help with the nausea and help get rid of the cramps and pain my constipation cause. [summary]: "}

'Stop crying. Tell me what you want.'  She also says it again in S06E07,  Listen to me. If you're so broken that there's no coming back, take a knife and cut your wrists. End it. But if you're staying, Theon, I need you.' \n \n It's a sentiment that Sansa repeats to Jon,  'I want you to help me. But I'll do it myself if I have to.' \n \n \n We know who's still alive - the two brothers who weren't allowed to fall apart, and the three mothers/sisters who were willing to go ahead even without their support. Yara was willing to let Theon kill himself. Sansa took that risk with Jon and Rickon. Cersei had pretty much given in to the prophecy, and sent Jaime away so he wouldn't be captured. But Margaery tried to save Loras right to the end. \n The trust element also continues in the last two episodes with how Sansa and Cersei leave Jon and Jaime out of their decisions. I personally believe Sansa and Cersei made those choices because they didn't trust Jon and Jaime to make the 'right' decisions that would protect them. (I'm keeping it neutral here, but when I say 'right' I mean the decisions that Sansa and Cersei believed were necessary.) Which is how they differ from Yara who is all or nothing. If Theon is in, he's  in . Also Yara needs no protection. \n We see all four again in the finale, with different shots. Margaery watches from above as Loras confesses, but the last shot is of them together. We see Jon and Sansa in the same frames in all their scenes: standing together, seated together, and then with one of them standing and seated. Theon and Yara are together. Jaime and Cersei watch each other from afar. \n (Anyone want to talk about Tyrion and Dany?) \n Going back to protection and trust, its something both Jon and Jaime talk to their sisters about this season as well.

But again, both Sansa and Cersei choose to place their fates in the hands of people they have very little respect for. \n Which can also be compared to the trust Lyanna places in Ned in the finale.

In an online context I find it very easy for me to ignore after having expressed as calmly as I can why they shouldn\u2019t say it but I certainly understand why others may not.

In fact, in today\u2019s world the study of things LGBT is often referred to as Queer Studies or Queer Theory, in that way the word Queer was reclaimed from an offensive word to one that many of us take ownership of. Additionally the word fairy, which seems particularly popular in the Southern States today, was actually something that the LGBT community embraced in the 1920s and 40s.

{"input_text": "Obviously there are other factors contributing to the graph that aren't seen or mentioned--for one, Running Man used to be in the  first  time slot of Good Sunday, where ratings just naturally tend to be lower than the second slot. \n Ultimately, RM's biggest problem isn't so much itself as it is the competition--Real Men and 1N2D are just unbeatable right now.  The lack of a strong lead-in in the first spot is also a problem. \n Another thing that the graph doesn't show is  demographics .  The South Korean viewing audience skews older, which is why more people gravitate towards shows like 1N2D and Real Men (which taps into the shared experience of military service) than Running Man, which tends to bring in younger people as guests and as viewers.  Back when \"I Am a Singer\" was kicking everyone else's butts in the ratings, someone did an article on the demographic breakdown of the Sunday Night Varieties, and it showed that while Running Man was trounced in the overall numbers, it was actually coming in first in all the age groups under 30, and first among men between 30-40.  This is more important than overall ratings since this age group--people 40 and under--are the primary purchasers in the economy; they're the ones who buy the cool, new, pricey stuff, and they're the ones most influenced by commercials.  That's not to say that RM is doing as well now than it was two years ago when it comes to these demographics; I'm just saying that these numbers--whatever they are now--are more important to the sponsors than the overall numbers, and that in this respect RM could actually be doing not as badly as it seems. \n Creativity-wise, we need to distinguish between what we fans like(d) from the show versus what scores high ratings.  I know a lot of us think that RM's \"classic\" format of bells hide-and-seek was the best thing ever, but most of us forget that those episodes were among the show's lowest-rated overall. \n The show is quite long in the tooth now, and could use a revamp.  But there's nothing inherently wrong with the basic format of mini-games culminating in a main game--they need to come up with some more clever games, of course, but the format itself is designed to evolve (which is what it did in its first couple of years).  Personally, I was never fond of the \"playacting\" element of the show, and preferred the more straightforward approach of older episodes.  Ultimately, though, the real problem--and this may be an unpopular opinion--is the cast.  They've gone stagnant, and the schticks and relationships are too familiar and predictable.  I think that to turn things around, the best thing RM can do is shake up its cast.  When the show started out, Gary, Joong Ki, Gwang Soo, and Ji Hyo were variety newbies; now that they're old veterans, I think it's time for some of them (and maybe a couple of the other members) to graduate and take on new challenges, and for a new set of variety newcomers for YJS and whoever else remains to take under their wing and generate  new  character dynamics.   There was a time when I would have considered a cast change as risky for the show, but at this point, there's nothing to lose, and it's probably the only way the show can generate some buzz and turn itself around. \n = [summary]: "}

{"input_text": "This feels like a silly question, because I'm 90% I'm right, but my friend is so adamant that something's wrong with me that I feel like I need some outside perspective. \n Essentially, my boyfriend Dan and I have been dating for four years. Two of those years were long-distance: we dated for one year, then I had to move for graduate school, and we were long-distance for the two years I was enrolled because he had just started a job that he couldn't leave. It was for the best and we were able to see each other once every 4-6 weeks (until summer or winter time, when I could move back for breaks, so we were really only long-distance 8 months out of the year). Things were actually really great and we never had a problem or an argument of any kind. \n However, we got used to dating/being together a certain way. It became a habit to call each other frequently to spend as much time as we could together and catch up on our days (since we usually couldn't text during work or class). We would call each other on the way to and from work/school, while we were cooking dinner, whenever we went on walks, and before we went to bed. And on weekends, if we decided to stay in, we'd often play video games and be on the phone together for most of that time. We never got bored of talking to each other and sometimes it was comforting just to have that presence together, even if we were doing something mundane. \n One year ago, I graduated from my program and moved back in with Dan. Things have been great (except for the revelation that I really hog the sheets in my sleep) and I personally think we have a healthy amount of time both together and apart. We're both believers in ensuring we have some aspects of our lives that are for us as individuals, so we make sure to hang out with our respective friends separately a good amount, take \"me\" time, go to the gym separately, have some different hobbies, and make sure we're not too cooped up in the house together 24/7. \n However. Dan has been promoted for his job and part of this means he's required to be on the road 3 days out of the week. When he's gone, we're not allowed to text/call as much except at night before he goes to sleep, because he's often traveling with his boss/coworkers. Even when we do call, he's usually exhausted and I don't want to keep him up too late since he has to get up early in the morning. So the amount of communication is not as much as when we lived across the country, and obviously not as much as when we're actually at home together. \n Truthfully, this does not really bother me one bit.  I know that Dan loves his job and I love that he loves it! I think we're both very happy and I don't consider any of this a \"problem\" or something that needs to be changed. I've developed a routine for when he's gone and when he's here and I think that things are in good balance and there's nothing lacking in our relationship. \n But, when he's gone, I miss him! I miss having him in bed at night and cooking dinner with him. I miss the sensation of talking to him even when I drive home from work or having his voice in my ear when I go grocery shopping, either in person or over the phone. I think I'm allowed to miss my boyfriend when he's gone. Sometimes when he's about to leave for his 3-day stint, I miss him before he's even gone, or even five minutes after he leaves! I feel like this is a common sensation for people when they're in love? Sometimes? Right? \n Again, to be clear, I am not clingy. I encourage Dan to go out and do things apart from me or spend time with his friends and am happy when he does so. I don't have anxieties or insecurities about what will happen when he's gone. And I don't  need  him to do any of the things I listed above: errands and chores and going to bed and et cetera. I'm perfectly fine doing it all on my own. It's just way more fun with him around! \n I just love him and miss his presence. I don't miss him in the way that I'm crying my heart out, it's just like, \"Aw, I miss him!\" I don't know how to explain it--I hope someone else gets what I mean. \n Anyway. My friend, Alice, has been my best friend since I was 18. She's been dating her boyfriend Chris for 8 months and talks about him frequently and has said that she thinks he's the one. About a week ago I asked her in a joking way if she ever felt that \"missing\" sensation - like \"do you ever spend the weekend together and then five minutes after he leaves, you already miss him?\" \n Alice had a reaction that I did NOT expect! She was like, \"Uh, NO????\" and had no idea what I was talking about. She probed further and we had a talk about it. Alice was flabbergasted that I felt this way and said that I was way too dependent on my boyfriend and that I should not be missing him that much. She said it's abnormal for us to talk that much (calling each other on the commute home or when we're bored on lunch breaks) and that there must be something wrong with my sense of self or security for me to \"rely\" on him that much. She said she chafes after being around her boyfriend that much and wants to get away from him and be by herself for a while, and that's what's normal, not spending an extensive amount of time with an SO and then kind of missing them after they leave. \n I was willing to chalk it up to just differences in worldviews/relationship styles and didn't really take offense, though I was surprised to hear she had NEVER felt a sensation like that before. But now Alice keeps texting me saying that she's worried about me, that she thinks I need a better sense of self-worth, that she wants me to go to a therapist. She has been texting me these links to therapists in my area! She has even implied that Dan may be manipulating me into feeling needy/dependent on him by purposefully acting distant... or that my \"missing\" feeling is really a subconscious fear that he's cheating on me. Finally, she said that if she ever felt that attached to a man, she'd feel ashamed of herself and says that I should focus on being self-sufficient and being prepared to get through life alone, \"should the worst happen.\" I'm kind of offended by this! \n So I guess I have two questions. 1) How do I politely tell my concerned friend that her concerns aren't warranted and that she can stop suggesting that I go to therapy over what I consider a non-issue? I know she just cares about me, so I don't want to be an asshole and hurt her feelings. But I feel like she's kind of being an asshole in her implications about my relationship and emotional state? \n 2) IS this an issue? Has no one else really felt this sensation before? AM I actually over-dependent or in some kind of unhealthy, abnormal dynamic and I'm just not realizing it? Perspectives and stories are welcome. [summary]: "}

I haven't told her because I don't feel like it's necessary--we never talk about religion, we never go to church, she's only a Christian by proximity. She still believes in God, but last night we talked about open mindedness and accepting others and she was way ahead of the curve for an 18 year old indoctrinated by her parents in the South. \n Basically, she talked about how it bothers her that people are bothered by gay marriage, and that even if it is \"wrong\" it's no one's business to decide that. I told her, exactly, and that it's not hurting anyone, and she seemed to think that was a really good point. She was also complaining about her father being dismissive of any new ideas (buddhism, islam, atheism, liberalism) and how she isn't necessarily prescribing to any of those philosophies, she doesn't understand the harm in listening to them. \n That's when I told her--if your beliefs are true, then you should have no problem with people questioning them.

This is really my situation and I really do want honest and open feedback so that I know what I am getting into here.... \n I have been in a relationship with a Puerto Rican/Mexican woman for 7 years. We got engaged 4 years ago. We have children. I am white, 6'2, 280 lbs (a lot of muscle and fat). She is 5'5 - maybe 120lbs wet (very attractive.) \n Our sex life has always been adventurous - but its been just between us. We do it in public, try new things, so on and so on...\nA dry spell for our sex life would be going longer than 3 days without sex. She blows me probably twice a week. We have sex (anal/vaginal) probably an average of every day. I am very happy with her already - but as most men would be, always curious to be with different women. \n The thing is - for the past few years she started talking dirty to me about me being with other women while we were going at it. She had caught me cheating on her 5 years ago and that was often the topic of discussion - thinking about it turned her on and she LOVES talking about what I did with this other woman. \n Fast forward - we have just had a threesome with a female prostitute while we were having a couples getaway. It was fantastic. We are doing it again tonight. She has also started sending me to Asian Massage Parlors for happy endings... And then wants to hear about it when I get back... \n I have told her that this is all great, but I feel a little strange paying for this stuff when I can get it on the street for free. She wasn't ready for that yet. \n However - a few nights ago she got a little tipsy and laid down some ground rules for me to be with other women on my own. Right now they are - blow jobs ONLY, no-one from work, and no-one from school, she wants to see pictures, and it can't detract from my family life. \n Some of those things are going to be hard to find - but I think over time she will come around and allow more than blowjobs and won't require pictures. So thats cool. \n Just in case that was where this is headed - I have made it VERY clear to her I would not like to see her with another man. She says she doesn't want that so it doesn't matter. She says she may want to be with another woman - which I don't think I have a problem with as long as things don't change at home. She has said that if things didn't work out between us she would probably be with a woman. Again - that doesn't bother me as our bedroom is very much alive and well. \n I think her motivations are primarily, 1. She wants to explore her sexuality with other women (so far with me being present, but maybe on her own.) and 2. She genuinely enjoys watching and hearing about me being with other women (like a female cuckold).\nSo here is the advice I need: \n \n Are there any pitfalls that I am not seeing here? My relationship with her is very important and I don't want it to be damaged. \n \n What is the smartest way for me to continue to escalate this so that it continues to get better and she is still happy? I would love to be in a relationship with her where I can just have complete freedom to do my own thing and bring other women home to her (as long as that doesn't hurt our relationship). But I need to make sure she is comfortable and happy every step of the way. \n \n Is this a slippery slope - like to good to be true.

One old guy even flew off to a mystical land by tying masses of balloons to his house! Truly the technology of balloons have come a long way. We have always wanted bigger. Better. Stronger. \n But now we must create something incredible, something that will be remembered forever. The world will be shook by this new discovery. Our scientists have discovered that we can make a balloon to rival even the Lennypede! Yes, we shall create the  BIGGEST BALLOON EVER WITNESSED BY MANKIND! [summary]: "}

And does anyone know anything about the musicians who performed? I'm assuming they are European, but is it an actual band or small orchestra of some sort? Please discuss and add on. \n Personally, by the way, I thought the soundtrack was very encapsulating and original, and the blending of folk music from medieval Germany as well as other Germanic/Celto-Germanic cultures, and some other folk genres, mixed with classical-inspired string and flute music, all orchestrated beautifully. It was incredibly refreshing to listen to, and there is so much variety and emotion put into it, with excellent and moving composure. There are so many emotions and feelings that can be induced so easily from this immersive soundtrack - I love it. This Yoshino guy has an incredible understanding of his music and all aspects of it, with everything seeming quite deliberate to a certain degree, but there was an extra umph, a great level of feeling dissolved into it by the musicians themselves and their cooperation, making it all so exacting and absorbing.

{"input_text": "Hi all. This is my first time posting, and it will probably be a long one. I need advice on how to handle a situation (or to leave it alone) that deals with my ex- best friend. \n Background information: \n *My ex best friend (we will call her Linda) and I first met in middle school. We didn\u2019t get along at first, but bonded over small things and finally became very close. We had been inseparable since the 6th grade. \n *Linda has always been more quiet and reserved, while I am more outgoing. She is more passive aggressive, where I am more direct. She is also more of a people person, where I am more of a \u201cclose knit\u201d kind of girl. Also, another very important thing, which has affected our friendship before, is that she is a Christian and I am an Agnostic. \n *We have had ups and downs, like most people. Even though we were very close, there were some mistakes made from both of us. For example, she was jealous of my successes (in school / university, sports teams, and jobs), and constantly tried to bring me down by undermining my achievements. And I was (and still am) manic depressive, and was not always there for her when she needed me to be, which am not proud of. \n *We had a large fight when she first started college, and when I was a senior in high school where she told me I wasn\u2019t good enough to be her friend, and we did not talk for a year after that. She claimed I wasn\u2019t Christian enough, and abandoned me one day, and didn\u2019t talk to me after that. It was a very bad time for me, since I was going through a lot, and was feeling suicidal. I was really hurt by her, and tried multiple times for a renewed friendship, but it did not happen until a year later, where she broke down, apologized, and we restarted our friendship. \n (To be clear about this, I don\u2019t think I really ever got over that fight, but I really did try. I worked more on myself, respected her beliefs more, and became kinder and tried to let go of my anger. I thought it worked, because eventually we were right back into our groove. Inseparable again. But anyway, we moved on. But our friendship wasn\u2019t quite the same. Usually it was. About 90% of the time, we were fine, but the other 10% just wasn\u2019t right. I don\u2019t know how to describe it.) \n Current Situation: \n *In August of last year, I broke up with my long term boyfriend of seven years. It was a horrible relationship. He was abusive and had many faults, but I loved him. Linda never liked him, and she was right not to. But anyway, the relationship finally ended. But it ended badly. I was a wreck. I called Linda that night to see if she could come over. She said she was on her way. After a few minutes, I realized that I needed to be alone. I wanted to process my feelings and be with my mom, so I called her back and asked her not to come after all. I wasn\u2019t angry, wasn\u2019t rude to her- and she seemed understanding. She said \u201cOkay. I will call you tomorrow. Bye!\u201d \n *Well, I never got the call. I waited for her to. But it never came. I cannot describe to you how painful the next few months were for me. My ex stalked me, harassed me, threatened me, and everything else you can think of. He made my life living hell, and I was still under his control even though we weren\u2019t together. It took me months before I cut all contact with him and filed a restraining order. Well, in all of that time, she never called me, never texted me, never spoke to me. I couldn\u2019t believe it. I really, honestly couldn\u2019t fathom it. Not one word. And I was going through hell. \n *Finally I got a word from her. She posted to my Facebook wall: \u201cHey! Miss you!\u201d And I could just feel the anger and resentment bubble up in me. How could she do that? She was practically my sister and then she abandoned me a second time for no reason. And now this? Acting like all is okay? Well, I didn\u2019t reply, and ever since then, she has only posted one more thing to my wall, which was a picture of a cat. (?!) We have not been in contact for 6 months. I have heard nothing from her. \n *I know that I made a mistake by not confronting her when she first broke contact.  I should have called her, or texted her or something. I should have done what I usually do. When someone makes me mad, I talk about it with them until the situation is resolved, but I didn\u2019t do anything about it. I really regret that, but it\u2019s done now, and I can\u2019t do it over again. \n I feel hurt, broken, and angry. Still. I can\u2019t seem to let go of this. I have dreams about it. I stress about what I did wrong. And I cannot figure it out. Can anyone help me shed light on this situation? Does anyone have any advice for me, or another perspective? Should I finally confront her, or should I leave it alone? I feel like I need closure, but every time I sit down and write out a letter to her, I am just too angry to finish. She has seemed to have totally moved on. I saw her the other week at the grocery store, and tried to go up to her, but she literally looked at me and walked fast in the other direction. [summary]: "}
{"input_text": "As noted elsewhere, do not refrain from asking librarians and museum workers questions.

I understand that it may be necessary if one lacks access to an academic library (and I will soon be in that realm), but it isn't that great for several reasons. The first reason is that the regular Google search engine is actually more proficient at locating books and articles than Scholar is, given that these two search engines use different algorithms with the regular search engine having a much more robust and refined search algorithm. Second, the Google Scholar algorithm is constantly (relative to a search engine) changing, so that one query made one week can have very different results in the next week which is very ineffective in trying to recreate a search query. Third, Scholar doesn't handle partial titles of articles well due in part to...Four, Scholar relies on the # of citations in determining the page ranking of query results so that something with hundreds of citations that is tertiary to the topic will outrank something with only dozens or citations despite being highly relevant to the topic. Finally, Google Scholar does not distinguish between copies of articles that you are legally allowed to have (under fair use, open access, whatever) and proprietary, restricted, or heavily copyrighted materials and firmly puts the onus of making that distinction on the user.

{"input_text": "Electrician here. I have done a number of medical/legal grows, and I'll try to relate my experiences as well as possible. \n If you have a super tight budget, go 400w HPS magnetic. Why? Magnetic ballasts are cheaper, components are replaceable, and you won't spend a fortune on lamps. However, the ballast also throws a good bit of heat and makes more noise than a digi, in addition to having a lower lumen/kWh ratio. \n If you have the money to spend, do your homework and find yourself a good 600w digital dimmable ballast, (lumatek was suggested and is a great option). \n Why? \n Digital ballasts run cooler, and produce more lumens per watt of consumed power. Lumatek dimming means you can purchase a 400w MH to veg your babies, and your cool tube means you can get your lamp extra close. Go online and look around for an effective lumens vs distance graph and you'll see why this distance is so important. In the summer, when temps run high, you can use a 400w HPS in flower to combat the heat. If you are using the A/C in your house on overdrive, it's just costing you money. Yes, 600w lamps are extraordinarily expensive, but there is no reason you can't use just one 600W HPS for your entire veg/flower cycle. Upgrade to a 400/600W MH when you can, as cash allows. \nIf you are looking to expand in the future, instead of moving to a 1000W, you can add another 600W digi, covering more area, with your two 600s consuming roughly the same amount of power as one 1000W magnetic. \n One other concern here that wasn't addressed is the fact that what you are doing is most likely illegal. A digital ballast is plug and play, allowing for a speedy takedown if needed. Pull your ballast, pull your tube/lamp, pull your plants. A standard IEC (I think that is the acronym) cord just like your power cord for your PC is all that's needed. \n One final note:\nNEVER, and I mean never, use your super lumens. The reduction in lamp life will cost you much more in the long run than your increase in yield. Not worth it. [summary]: "}

{"input_text": "This is just a quick day 30 update and will hopefully serve as an encouragement to others. \n I had been trying to quit fapping for a good 2 or 3 years before I found this subreddit. Most of the time I didn\u2019t make it far\u2014maybe a week or so and then relapse. Every once in while I made it a month or two but still fell back into old habits. \n Then I found this community and decided to really end this thing once and for all. To make a conscious effort to fight the urges and exercise some self control over my body. Last time I relapsed I was at 24 days, and before that, 14 days. So I am making some progress. And to be honest, the first 3 weeks weren\u2019t all that hard, occasionally I\u2019d get turned on by something and have to force myself to leave the room or do something, but for the most part it wasn\u2019t bad, until day 23. \n At that point I was hit with some serious urges and it seemed like any little thing could get me going. And it was also at that point that I realized I didn\u2019t just have a habit (break-able in 21 days) but an addiction (completely different animal). I realized that many of my thoughts and desires were centered around pleasuring myself sexually. \n Someone used the phrase \u201cbeat the meat\u201d in an immature conversation we were having and that saying really struck me. We say \u201cbeat the meat\u201d as if we are masters of our bodies, beating our slaves (our penises). But in reality, after going only 30 days in this challenge, I have found that it is quite the opposite. WE are the slaves to our sexual organs. Sex is not the end all be all of happiness. So don\u2019t believe the lies you\u2019ve trained your mind to believe! Don\u2019t pay for your own destruction! \n As far as the effects of abstaining, I actually haven\u2019t noticed many. I think that you notice more positive effects if your if addiction is more extreme (I was going maybe 3 times a week before). Of the effects I have noticed, the first is my natural tendency to make eye contact with everyone, not just girls, which has helped strengthen my relationships, as you can imagine. The other thing I\u2019ve noticed is something others on here have seen as a negative side effect. They say they feel a bit more aggressive and even angry. I have experienced this, but I have also experienced more joy when I am happy, greater concentration when focused, and in my care for others I care more. I think fapping keeps you at a constant \u201cdon\u2019t really give a crap about anything\u201d mood. While not doing so increases the intensity of your emotions, which I don\u2019t think is a bad thing at all. Just like fapping, learn self control for your anger. \n So if I\u2019m stealing stars from Mario, I have 119 to go\u2014almost 10 years. And I fully intend to make it there and hopefully at that point consider myself completely free of this addiction. \n To those on the fence about joining: watch the YBOP videos. And if you still feel like you don\u2019t want to give up PMO\u2014then that\u2019s proof enough you\u2019re addicted. Giving it up is the best thing you can for yourself right now. It\u2019ll help in more ways than you can imagine. \n To my fellow fapstronauts: stay strong! If you blow it, reset your badge and start a new streak the next day! In this issue, trying and failing over and over is infinitely better than not trying at all and surrendering to your addiction. [summary]: "}

I was sitting there with some friends in my buddys apartment (my one friend Jay was sober to make sure nothing went wrong).

I thought this was a perfectly reasonable thing to do when you get hot. I then scratched off a scratch ticket I bought earlier that day. I started freaking out because I won $5000. The ticket actually didn't win anything. I kept insisting that I should go back to the store to cash it in (all while still naked).

{"input_text": "Of course every school is different.  But let me give you a few bits of advice. \n My experience as a Transfer student from a CC.  My university placed transfer students in the lower division.  They did this for a number of reasons, one being that most CC do not offer more than calc 2, and at my school you could not be in the upper division until all the calc classes where finished.  Also this was not really a big deal, as all the upper division classes had all the calc classes as prerequisites, so you couldn't take them until after the calc classes anyway.  So, don't worry about this, there where plenty of required classes for my Major that where not upper division so it just didn't matter.  I have no regrets with the CC.  It added a year that I could have saved not going there, but that had as much to do with an internship as anything.  I also saved a heck of a of money.  2 years at the CC, cost less than one semester at University. \n I assume you are in Cali, based on the schools you applied to.  This recommendation you can take or leave, go to a school as far from home as you can.  In other words leave Cali.  How good a school only matters to a point, what matters most is how well you do, and that you have good internships and coops.  Go to the east coast, or go to the Midwest, both have as good or better engineering schools.  I'll plug my Alma mater, the U of M, it has a great Aerospace engineering program, not an emphasis but the full on degree.  For what its worth, emphasis are not worth much, if you can't get at least a minor in something, its almost not worth putting on a resume. \n Last, I know you are young, and I know people are saying, don't lock in yet, let yourself bloom.  I don't buy it, plan things out now.  Have an end game.  If you have a plan, you can always change it, but if you set good goals, and work hard to reach them, lots of things will fall into place.  GPA matters, but experience matters more, get coops and internships as soon as you possibly can, try and get one now.  First, it will tell you right away if you want to be doing what you are doing.  My sister was enrolled in Electrical Engineering, and after her freshman year got an internship, found out that she really had no interest in EE, switched to mechanical.  Had an internship the following summer, and it cemented her choice as what she wanted to do.  Switching from one Engineering to another is easy in the first 2 years, after that you are wasting your time and money.  I had internships every summer, and loved every moment of them, so I knew I had made the right choice with Civil Engineering.  I graduated with a ok GPA, nothing to write home about, but I also graduated with 4 very solid internships under my belt, and authorship on a research paper.  I worked for a grade student doing soil mechanics research, I was like the 6th author on the paper, but still it was research experience.  I had job offers before I graduated without applying for said jobs (networking during internships had people contacting me since they knew I was graduating), fiends I studied with who had better GPA's than me had a hard time getting jobs.  One I know never did get an engineering job (Macys paid for his collage and was his excuse for not getting an internship, he still works at Macys.)  He graduated with a 3.8, GPA is just not enough on its own.  Also a note on the internships, be bold and apply to them all over the world/US, don't stick to local ones, and don't stick to the ones your school recommends.  The best one I had took me 4 states away, and I was advised by an adviser not to bother with it.  This internship is without a doubt responsible for the job I ended up getting. \n Here in MN, GPA is based on a 4 point scale, so a 4.01 is meaningless, and would be impossible to be the schools average.  I have heard some states use a 5 point scale, but I have never experienced this myself.  I'll assume your using one of these 5 point scales.  The numbers I site above are based on the 4 point system.

{"input_text": "So this is my first real post ever on Reddit and I'm posting using a Karma Go hotspot which has become my lifesaver these past 24+ hours. Here's how it all went down. \n On 2/16/16 at 10:17AM exactly, I received an e-mail notification at work that my Nest thermostat had lost connection to the network. When I arrived home that evening around 5:30PM, my cable and internet were completely dead. I reset my router and modem and accessed the modem settings page which revealed that it was receiving no signal whatsoever. At that point, I called Comcast and the representative was nice enough to go through the troubleshooting with me to no avail. She scheduled me an appointment with a technician for 5-7P on Thursday, 2/18. \n After further investigating, I discovered that the coaxial cable specific to my unit had been cleanly cut near its midsection and that there was a good 3-4 foot section of cable missing. The end that connects to the cable distribution box for the complex had also been completely disconnected. To top it off, the workplace was a mess with pieces of cable and connectors scattered all over the ground, the cover to my individual cable distribution center removed and on the ground, and a lighter for good measure. I spoke to my neighbor who confirmed that he had Comcast out to install his cable and that the tech had stated he needed to replace a cable to his unit because it was old. The tech had arrived at approximately 10AM. \n I immediately called Comcast around 7:00PM to explain the situation and was informed that they would put in an emergency service request and gave me an \"ER\" case number. I should receive a call by 12:23AM. \n I woke up to no service (wasn't really expecting to) and went to work. Called from work around 10:30AM and was informed that the status on the ticket was \"We're on it\" which, I was told, meant  a technician was either en route or on site remedying the situation. I was monitoring my internet from work and, by 3:00PM, with no change, I decided to call for another update. This time, I'm told the status had been changed to \"resolved\" but clearly I still don't have an active connection. \n For nearly an hour I talk to a CS representative and her supervisor who each try to give me excuses as to why the service hadn't been resolved and, to make matters worse, why the routinely scheduled tech visit I had made prior to discovering Comcast's mistake was not the appropriate request and whoever came out would be unable to remedy the situation. I was told that this is a problem with the outside cables and that the earliest a technician could come out was Sunday, 2/21/16. I had previously made it explicitly clear that the entire problem was external to my apartment (when the representative supposedly escalated the issue) and that this was an extremely important point because I would be unable to meet the technician during the day. So they knew this information even before the first ER ticket was made. I was separately told be each of them that this issue could not be remedied any sooner because they were not allowed to escalate the issue unless it had been \"in the system\" for at least 14 days. In addition, there was no way they could call the regional distribution center to request a tech sooner because \"we don't have that number.\" After they reassured me that I would receive credit for the lost usage (woo hoo) I decided I was at a dead end and ended the call. About 2 hours ago, I resorted to tweeting Comcast directly and submitting feedback to Tom Karinshak, SVP of Customer Service. No response, no surprise. \n So, this is where I am. About an hour ago I found a phone number for the Comcast Escalations Department. I called and immediately got through to a representative, no stupid automated menu. He decided that because a free wire was hanging down over a doorway, that this was a safety issue and warranted emergent repair. He provided me with a new ER case number and assured me that I would be contacted within one hour. That phone call took place between 6:08-6:20 PM CST and it is now 7:16 PM. I've still not received a phone call. \n I feel I've exhausted all my options. I'm fed up and tired of dealing with this and just needed to rant. So if anyone has made it all the way through this, thanks for listening. I can try to post some pictures in a bit. [summary]: "}

I landed it in 2006, and before long, I felt like you do.  I said so, a little too loudly, and was fired from that job in early 2009. \n After that, I took a step backwards - was making $28k/yr because finding a job was hard in 2009 - it took me until mid-year to find this one.  Still the same area, still the same feeling.  I found a new job within a year. \n Middle of 2010, I was making $35k/yr again.  Same amount I was making 4 years ago.  Ugh.  Still, hadn't been working Web Dev at all.  However, this job had a lot of web developers there!  20 person company, 15 of them were web developers.

KaSa, when I first met her, she was around 340 pounds, easily. I started out as the sexy position as \"janitor\", I swept and mopped my way into recognition into what is known as the company's main staff trainer. KaSa was a \"Direct Support Professional\", otherwise known as a DSP, but she wasn't very professional and about the ugliest, fattest and meanest monster I have ever seen in my life. She had a lazy arm from a lack of circulation, smelled like stale cheese and was constantly sweaty every day, even in the coldest winters. \n Being a super sexy minor at the time, I was instructed to clean after the clients and the DSPs during and after the shifts; but do not interact with the clients. No prob, I am the janitor. Gonna sweep them flo' baby gurl. First week went well; spent time getting to know some of the staff, never entered the back room with people in it; but I figured it was time to give it a shot. The staff told me to enter and leave quickly as I might get stuck in what was known as the \"endless loop\". I laughed it off and waltzed off into the room. \n To explain the situation, it was a boss level. My patience was my life bar and my sarcasm was my mana bar. It took me 5 minutes to be depleted. KaSa was an excellent drainer in conversation. She always said something demeaning about herself herself and then fished for compliments. That is who she was and she expected nothing less.  \"Oh you're not fat at all, hon!\"  and  You're beautiful  is what she expected. She was about 4'5 and about 290 for the first year I worked there. She was pretty round, but she had an \"maybe ok, but not really ok face\". She was trying to be very friendly to me, but I wasn't very interested in doing anything for her, so I kinda made up excuses to get out like \"I have a toilet to unclog\" and \"Gotta go, gotta empty the mop bucket\". \n This goes on for a few months until I am mowing the office lawn by pushmower. It's around 6:30 in the morning and I look to the side and saw KaSa in a minivan. She parked in her spot, and lurched out of her minivan. Her vehicle looked like it was going to capside, poor minivan. Anyways, she waddles with a bag in her hands to the concrete steps that we have in the back and she positions herself right over the top step and drops like a sack mashed potatoes and concrete. I swear, if concrete could bruise, it would have looked like  Ouch. So she's sitting there and I'm mowing away, and I get close to her and I smell it. The smell of cheaply made chili. I look at her bag and I see Sheetz on it. Then I see a hot dog, and then I see the chili and cheese on it. It's 6:30 in the morning, and the the sun is juuust bright enough to let me see everything. KaSa is eating a chili cheese dog at 6 IN THE FUCKING MORNING. Not one, not two, not three, but not even FOUR. FIVE as in we're looking at 2000+ calories gone in 15 minutes. She ate a full meal's day in 15 minutes. And then some with her drink, a huge ass soda. My immediate reaction is to get nauseous as hell, but I'm a polite guy, so I try to store it in the back of my skull. That day, she had said she hasn't eaten at all today to a few staff. My vomit meter is going critical and I decided to get to another room to eat my lunch. \n Another few incidents like this happens, until one day she has this weird choking sound. She was choking on an actual chicken bone; and a bunch of EMTs had to take her to the hospital and remove the bone from her maw. After that, she had to take a few months off work to \"recover\" from the chicken incident. No one wanted to give her CPR as she was perma-greasy.

When I went upstairs, I saw her; and I tried to be nice and asked her if she wanted to head downstairs to play pool.

Then he came back out with another person, and they both got in my car and told me to go to another location. At this point, I was pretty scared, and drove them down the road again until they told me to stop. \n They had me pull into a driveway and cut my headlights, then just sat there for a minute whispering to each other. Finally, I heard the second person say, \"Just leave him alone, man, he drove us here and didn't ask any questions.\" Then they got out of the car and I hauled ass of the driveway and back to my house. \n I'm convinced that if that second guy hadn't said something, I wouldn't be around to tell this story. Luckily, no one ever showed up at my place again. I dodged a major bullet that evening. [summary]: "}
{"input_text": "It was my first year having moved away from home, and I lived in a very nice apartment complex.  There was a nice blending of older people and younger people about my age.  Occasionally, you could hear one of the couples in my area of the complex banging but that was only on weekends very early in the morning.  All in all, living there was a 10/10 experience until Walter White moved in.  I call him Walter White, because he looked like Heisenberg if he hit the crystal, and because he was a criminal.  I also call him Walter White because I can't remember his name. \n I live in Southern California, but it's not the part of Southern California you see on TV (although the specific city was the original setting of Breaking Bad.)  Poverty and drugs are both massive problems.  At the time I lived in a nicer area of the city, and when the guy I moved in I assumed that he was cool.  He drove a Ford Bronco that looked like shit, and was constantly working on it in the middle of the parking lot.  Some times I'd see him while coming or going or taking out the trash.  I'd smile, nod, he'd do the same.  This was the routine.  It was safe and comfortable. \n One day while taking out the trash (without greeting me) he asked, \"Hey, smoke reefer?\"  I was listening to music so I just smiled and booked it back to my apartment.  This happened a couple of times.  Eventually I told him no.  This did not dissuade him.  My room mate was a big straight edge.guy but I didn't say anything because I didn't want to cause problems. \n People start hanging out at his apartment constantly.  They don't took clean, most of them are bros who couldn't be older than twenty.  He lived on the first floor, and had an enclosed patio that was filled with bikes (we'll get back to that later) and he started covering the windows with bed sheets.  This carries on for a few months, I try to time my trips out around him.  Eventually the property manager drops by and asks me about him, tells me that some people have had some problems and asks me if I've noticed anything weird.  Wanting to stay out of it, I just tell her that I never see him. \n One night, my wife, her friend, and I park.  The parking lot is well-lit, and this guy materializes out of nowhere.  \"Hey, smoke reefer?\"  My wife's idiot friend responds, \"yeahhh.\"  He says, \"hold out your hand,\" and she does.  He drops what has to be a gram of mary jane into her palm.  He says, \"You know where to find me,\" and then he disappears. \n Fast forward.  Mister White is having a party with what I assume is his family.  It's loud but a weekend and the middle of the day so IDGAF.  Police show up, sirens blaring.  He starts screaming, we go outside and he's in handcuffs, and the police are taking him away.  He's screaming \"You guys are fucking nazis man!  I'm just trying to support my family!  A fella has a right to support his family!\"  I sigh with relief because I assume this dude is going away for a while.  I ask my property manager what happened. \n The guy had threatened to kill our neighbor with a knife.  I have no idea why, when ever I saw the neighbor he was incredibly polite.  I assume that it was racially motivated because the guy was Hispanic.  This adds a delightful seething level of racism and violence beneath the gruff appearance of a drug dealer who has the ability to manifest himself at night.  Whenever I come home I sneak in and out.  I take different routes through the complex to avoid him. \n A few days later, there's a knock at the door.  I answer and it's Walter.  He's leaning, his hand on my door frame.  \"Hey man,\" he says, \"how are you doing?\"  I tell him I'm fine, \"How are you, Walter?\" I ask.  He says, \"I'm good.  The neighbor called the cops on me.  A guy's just trying to support his family.\"  Then he starts talking about how he was in lock up because he has schizophrenia and the cops confiscated his plants.  \"Yeah,\" I respond.  \"Do you have a cigarette lighter?\"  I do because at the time I have a pack a day habit (but by this time I've moved my smoking time indoors for obvious reasons).  I nod, grab one from my pocket and hand it to him.  He says, \"thanks man.\" \n Then he looks me dead in the eyes.  I can remember this moment.  This is what it must have been like to be a member of the Manson family.  He had some of the (cliche ahoy) bluest eyes I had ever seen, and it felt like I was falling into them.  He asks me how I'm doing, and I respond, \"I'm okay,\" and he says, \"Don't worry about your mother, man.  Mine was hard on me too, you know?  You gotta go with what you feel in your heart.  You're okay.\"  I don't know what prompted this; I'm most disturbed by the fact that at the time I was at odds with my mom about some inconsequential shit and I was feeling down about it.  The minute I close the door, I think to myself that the guy has to either be some type of psychic, listening in on my apartment, or Satan come to drag me down to Hell. \n Progressively, I retreat deeper and deeper into my apartment.  There's a smell coming from the guy's apartment.  It smells like metal and jizz.  More bikes are piled into his backyard.  He's brought a shed into the parking lot and has it connected to a generator.  We can hear saws and tools.  It's at this moment that I realize, \"oh, that's why he has so many bikes.  He's a bike thief and this is a chop shop.  This is what my home has become.\" \n This is the last straw and he's evicted.  He's not \"evicted\" evicted because of his rights as a renter and keeps paying his rent, but they keep posting eviction notices on his door.  He and his old lady keep fighting.  One day I'm coming home and he's sitting outside crying, he runs up to me and says, \"My old lady left me man, my old lady left me.  She took my silver man.  She took my mama's silver!\"  He keeps going on.  I don't remember how I tactfully evaded this, but I'm pretty sure that I didn't and that I just said \"uh\" and went upstairs.  At this point I feel kind of sorry for the guy because he's clearly a mess. \n Later, he's left and his \"old lady\" lives there now because her name is on the lease.  One day I'm coming home, and this kid is sitting on the steps.  He's probably like 14.  He asks me, \"Do you know a guy that lives in that apartment named Walter White?\" and I say, \"I know him, why?\" and the kid starts talking about how it's his dad.  He came by to \"kick his ass\" because of something to do with the kid's little brother.  The kid starts talking about how he's a son of a bitch.  While he's talking about what a son of a bitch his dad is, he pulls a lighter and cigarette out of his pocket and starts smoking.  The kid tells me that the dude has been in and out of psych hospitals ever since he (the kid) was born.  I tell him that if I see Walter again, I'll tell him that he's looking for him. \n Fast forward, I'm coming home and I see the window next to Walter's front door is broken.  I assume this has something to do with either the eviction, another arrest, or just a random act of violence.  I have a smoke on my patio, and I hear Walter's \"old lady\" come home. Then I hear her scream and she doesn't stop.  Of course, I call the police. \n They show up, I sit on my porch, listening.  His \"old lady\" is crying, \"don't take him away!\" and he's screaming about how they're nazis.  By this point, I've made the decision to move and only have about two weeks left in that apartment.  I'm between semesters so I make the decision not to go outside unless I know for sure that guy isn't there. \n On my last day at the apartment, I grab lunch before my wife and I leave for our new place.  I come home, start to walk up the stairs, and Walter comes out of his apartment.  He stands in the door way, silent, glaring at me.  I bring my wife the food and tell her to eat quickly because we're leaving as soon as she finishes. \n I don't even want to know what would have happened to me if I had stayed another day in that complex.

{"input_text": "My friend and I are both 17 and we have known each other since around December 2011, so a year and a few months. Over the past few months I've become increasingly resentful of him and his general attitude, and a couple of weeks ago I decided it was time to move on. I guess I'll make a laundry list of all the reasons why I dislike him so much: \n \n He's recently developed a pattern of petty theft, justified by saying that corporations (like Target and Walmart) can \"afford it\". \n He talks down on nearly everybody behind their backs, including me at some points. \n He constantly relies on me for homework help which generally ends with him just asking me to do it for him, which I've usually done because it's easier than dealing with his abrasive attitude. \n He cheats his way through school. \n He never asks for something. Instead of proposing something with a question, like \"can I come over to your house today?\", he'll call and state \"I'm coming to your house now.\" \n We haven't hung out or even talked in about 5 to 6 weeks. We used to hang out every weekend, and while I've been busy lately, I also feel that he only did it for car rides. \n He always pushes me to take debts. \n When a teacher of ours committed suicide, he laughed it off and said it was good because the teacher had given a mutual friend some bad grades in the past. \n He has always made fun of my mannerisms, interests and appearance. While I'd say that this has made me less socially awkward, he uses this fact against me and could've easily done it more nicely. \n I have never been able to trust him with a single secret, nor talk to him on a personal level as with other friends. \n He's big into masculinity and has no emotional depth. This is best shown with how he labels people, including myself, as pussies and faggots. \n I can't talk to him about problems with our friendship. He constantly guilt-trips people (I've seen him do it to other friends and myself) and has such a massive ego that he would only take it as an insult, or try and pull some false sympathy to continue whatever benefit he gets. \n \n I decided to cancel my xbox live account yesterday, which he's been using for a few months now. This is $10 a month that I'm no longer willing to spend, as I never play it in the first place. This has resulted in him calling me at least 20 times over the past 12 hours, which I feel proves that he is only using me for his own benefit. That, and he tried to convince me a few weeks ago that I should keep helping him with his ridiculous homework for \"a few more months,\" even though I'm already busy enough as-is. It was at that point that I considered simply not tolerating this anymore. \n This has been on my mind for a very long time, especially since his very presence puts me in a bad mood. He irritates me and I simply don't want to be associated with him anymore. Still, not everything about our friendship has been bad. We've had plenty of good times and sometimes he's capable of being a nice person. I can't help but feel a little bad about stopping this. Am I doing the right thing? [summary]: "}
{"input_text": "I enjoyed reading this analysis. \n My roommate is super down on Stafford and the Lions. He doesn't think that he's any good, and that he is not a qb for the future. I think that is silly, and basically what you've written is the reason why. \n A rookie OC, along with a new system and an offensive line that has been mediocre at best has stunted the offense. This O, had we had consistently above average play from the line, would most likely be lighting up the scoreboard every week. Stafford hasn't had the time to throw, hasn't had the time to make the decisions we know he can. I don't think that he will get to the hall just yet. But (just like Doug Karsch likes to say) he is a quarterback we can win with. I use the example of Joe Flacco all the time. Ok to just above average quarterback, who wins a superbowl because his defense plays great and he has a playoffs where he is just money. We've seen Stafford get hot before. Red hot, and sustained it through part of a season. All that is missing is doing that in the playoffs. [summary]: "}
{"input_text": "I feel this has to be said. The current method of farming is intentional, and in my mind, pretty nice. When you enter Inferno, you farm A1 because your gear is bad and/or your play-style is sloppy. \n With some shoddy gear that you can pick up on AH for like 500k, you can easily farm A1, and easily clear A2 (maybe farm it). You reach A3 and die a lot. \n At that point, farming A1 seems like a good deal-- because your gear is bad. With terrible gear, you progress through A3 at 4x slower than A1, and risk dying a lot, so it's a bad deal. When you get better gear, you'll progress through A3 faster and safer, and it'll be worth it. \n To me, this is a nice system. I spent time farming A1 because it was  efficient , not because I was forced to. Then I switched to A2. In the last few days, I've finally gotten geared enough to comfortably farm A3. It's still risky and challenging, but it's now considerably more efficient than farming A1 or A2. [summary]: "}
{"input_text": "This is my first time building a computer and I have had the absolute worst luck. \n So, back in July, I wanted to build a new PC for use in university. It didn't seem too difficult to me, so I ordered my parts and waited for them to come in. \n It turns out Amazon had lost my order of my case. Whatever. They sent it out again, but it didn't come in until around two weeks before I had to leave. \n I began my external build, and after plugging in my CPU, HSF, GPU and RAM, I connected my monitor only to find that no signal was being transmitted. After a few hours of troubleshooting and a call to Gigabyte, I was informed that the PCI x16 slot on my MOBO was defective. \n Ugh, whatever. Sent that back, and received a replacement from Newegg three days before I had to leave. Frantically began my build again only to find that the second RAM slot on the replacement MOBO they sent me was also defective. Not wanting to have to reorder another mobo since I wanted the build done before I had to leave, I decided to forge ahead with only one RAM slot. External build went fine (aside from the RAM thing) so I figured I was ready to start the internal build. \n After some initial confusion, I was finally able to get my internal build completed. I installed Windows 8 and everything seemed to be running smoothly until I began the process of downloading and installing drivers for my various parts. \n First, I installed my WNA driver. No problems there. I then went to Gigabyte's website to find the rest of the drivers and began the process. However, after installing some of the drivers and being prompted to restart, the computer froze and bluescreened during the restart, giving me a machine-check exception. Concerned, I figured I had simply installed the drivers wrong. \n Windows 8 recommended I refresh my system, wiping the recent installations. Upon attempting to reinstall my WNA driver, the computer would then proceed to freeze on the final step. \n After a strenuous series of restarts and system wipes all ending with the same results, I called up my local computer tech help. They recommended I only install the drivers that were necessary, believing that Windows 8 \"didn't like\" some of the drivers I was receiving from Gigabyte's site. This ultimately did nothing to help as I continued to receive the same errors. By this point, I had to leave for university. I resolved to find myself some computer expert in Ottawa and pay them until my computer worked. \n I found an on-campus tech support who offered to run a diagnostics check this Tuesday. I received a call from them Thursday telling me that my hard drive was defective. \n This astounded me. It seems to me that it is very unlikely that the hard disk drive is the problem, considering that I only ever installed Win8 and the drivers to my solid state drive. Upon informing the clerk of this, he then suggested the problem might be the motherboard. \n So that's where I'm at now. I wanted to make a post here asking for some potential help and recommendations before ordering a new motherboard (again), only to be sent yet another defect. Could it be the motherboard? Is the hard disk drive defective at all, or is that simply the motherboard fucking things up again? Any help or suggestions would be much appreciated. [summary]: "}

{"input_text": "Okay, this is how I understand it. It's pretty long, is heavily simplified and has some unnecessary stuff but I'm a big fan of unnecessary stuff so hang on: \n Let's assume we've traveled to the time just before the formation of trees. The land is filled with plants as well as microbes and small animals. The plants take in carbon dioxide from the air and use the energy of the sun to convert it to organic compounds. When plants die, microbes break down those compounds to use the stored energy and release the carbon dioxide into the air. This is one branch of the carbon cycle and it is still active today. \n The plants growing on land are mostly of similar height, a couple of feet at most, and they're all competing for sunlight. They would get more sunlight if they were taller, but to do that without bending, their cell walls would have to be stronger and more rigid. When an offspring of a plant produces a slightly stronger organic polymer for their cell walls, it grows taller than the others, gets slightly more sunlight, and as a result, reproduce more, passing the aberration along. After many generations, one offspring produces a form of the lignin molecule which is much tougher than the polymers produced by the other plants and allows it to grow much taller. This plant, I guess we can call it a tree, has virtually no competition for sunlight and can reproduce much more than the others. The age of trees has begun. \n Now, the other, smaller plants are still there, along with the bacteria that decompose them, although this bacteria can't break through the new organic polymers of the taller plants, let alone the lignin in trees. When the trees die, they just fall over and stay there. They pile up over the course of millions of years and some of them become fossilized while others gradually turn into the coal we use today. \n Here's a sidenote: Trees, like other plants, take carbon dioxide from the air and retain some of it in their structure. This process is called carbon fixing. Now, since bacteria can't decompose trees yet, this carbon stays trapped and is not released through decomposition. On the other hand, the trees produced oxygen while they lived, also like other plants. As a result, during the period when trees were non-biodegradable, the CO2 level in the atmosphere decreased and the O2 level increased, both significantly. This led to many interesting and fascinating changes in animal life during that period. \n However, since reproduction isn't a perfect process, the bacteria gradually change as well. Some of the changes are bad and those branches die out. But some are good. Some bacteria are born with the ability to 'chew through' the tough polymers to get to the good stuff, giving them access to more food which means those branches, along with their anomaly, multiply rapidly. Over several million years, these bacteria develop the ability to eat through tougher and tougher polymers until one branch is born with the ability to degrade lignin. At this point, all the other types of bacteria are present as well, each eating the type of food it can digest. However, our lignin-decomposing friend finds itself in the middle of an all you can eat buffet. Remember those mountainous stacks of trees? No one is eating them except our little friend here and as a result it reproduces like crazy. Soon, we have an entire class of bacteria that can degrade trees. [summary]: "}

{"input_text": "I'm a 20 year old guy on second semester at the university. I live at home and is moving out at summer(common at this age in my country) with a friend from public school. \n Details about me as a person: \n I'm 1,73m, not ugly nor handsome and a mix between thin/normal size. \n I've never had any relationships beyond being friends. I'm not very shy and I don't mind talking to strangers, in fact when I talk to strangers, I am often the one that started the conversation. I don't have problems opening up to anyone (assuming context generally, but even if someone asks something very personal, I'll gladly answer), I don't have trust problems and I don't get embarrassed very easily. \n I get along with every single person I've ever talked to and I can't recall a quarrel or fight I've ever had with anyone. I don't have a large amount of friends. I've been getting well along with everyone where I'm at (work, school, home), but I very rarely meet up or talk too much with people outside of these areas. \n I have a few very good friends from previous education whom I talk with pretty much once every day or second over Skype. On top of those, I have another group of friends from same previous education that I meet up with every second week for boardgame night and film night every 1-2 month. These very close friends are also part of the ones coming at the boardgame/film nights. \n Important detail is that I never feel lonely. \n I don't drink, smoke or anything alike. \n If someone asks \"Do you want to go watch this museum/film in cinema/do this sport activity/help me move\", or pretty much any other direct activity with something specific to do, I'd love to. \n Though, if someone asks me if I want to go to a bar, have a drink, talk and call it a day, I'll say no. I don't see any interest in just that, even though I don't have problems talking with people. I just don't feel anything exciting about situations dedicated to talking. \n We get assigned study groups for half the stuff at university and these are also people that I get along with very well, but never meet up with outside of university. \n Outside of weekly work and education, I spent most of my free time playing games/watching series/reading/other stuff, somewhere a 70/10/10/10 split, respectively, so yes, I spend a lot of time playing. \n I don't do sports, but I don't have problems with them either. Occasionally, although rarely, I run, but other than that I take my bike 9 kilometers to university (and of course 9 back) every single or second day. \n So here's the problem: \n I don't know if everything I've described is fine, but I feel fantastic, am always happy and have no problems with anything at the moment. I don't mind that I've never had a relationship with anyone or even had strong feelings towards someone. I feel perfectly well doing what I do now. \n Even when I have a weekend with nothing to do, I love to spend my time just playing games/watching stuff/walking the dog. \n It's not like I don't like talking or doing stuff with people outside of school/work, but I never ask anyone because I don't specifically want to(not in a negative sense, just very neutral). If anyone would ask me, I'd probably say yes. \n What I'm thinking about is the future. Lots of people tell of how it gets harder to start relationships as you get older, but I don't feel like doing anything now, as I'm just fine as it is now. In one way, I feel like that's a problem and I should think ahead and try to get out more, but it feels counter-intuitive, since I don't want to and love my current situation.

{"input_text": "I have known this girl, K (leaving full name out), since I was in preschool. We have been friends just as long. I never much cared for relationships and dating until the last few years. I thought I fell in love with a girl who was awesome, T (again, no full name), she was my best friend, I talked to her all the time, blah blah she isn't the main focus. When I realized I wasn't going to make it with T, especially after she started dating a mutual friend (we both knew we liked her, and now they are getting married), I started evaluating relationships. \n I realized I was very different around K, almost protective. She grew up religious, caring, and sweet while I grew up crude, agnostic, and listening to metal. But when I was with her I was always smiling, happy, calm. I was awkward around her. I was never awkward around people, just mostly quiet. The point being she brought an entirely new side of me out. \n Now fast forward a few years, I moved to Texas from Ohio. No longer was I just a short walk away from her so I could vent my feelings and see if there was approval or disapproval in what I said in relations to how she felt. I can always message her on Facebook, text her, call her, but I feel as if doing that is almost an insult to her. My father and most of my friends still live in Ohio, so It's possible that I can make up an excuse to visit so that I could talk to her face to face, but at this point I'm unsure if it would be worth saying. We live states apart, I'm positive she will be moving to go to school for music and I will be staying in Texas to most likely go in to software/game development while working retail, so even if the feelings are mutual it would almost be more heartbreaking to not be able to share those feelings together than to never know.

My girlfriend was out of town so I went with a buddy to drink and support a friend. \n Anyways there was this girl that I kept eyeing because she was pretty and just radiated happiness and positivity, she she started noticing and started giving me looks back. I had no plans on making moves though. \n By the time we got to the club Im pretty intoxicated. I spent the first 30 minutes dancing with my friends and alone because i have a girlfriend of course. However, the girl I was eyeing comes up to me and starts dancing on me I welcome her butt against my pelvic and place my hands on her side. She starts really getting into it and I as well, caressing her body and I start moving my pelvic in rhythm with her backside. Even though I'm really drunk I know what I'm doing is wrong and don't stop myself. This goes on for about 30 minutes and I kiss her neck she turns around and we make out. \n I eventually realize I can't do this and leave. \nHowever, an hour later we dance again and I let her. I'm such a piece of shit I know! \n On the party bus back I fight every intention I have to dance with her or kiss her even though she's dancing right in front of me. I really wanted to do it. \n When we get back to the house i sit down with my friend and a girl and she comes to sit next to me and we chat very casually she's being really flirty but I deny all moves and even start being mean to her so she doesn't like me.  It hurt me too because this girl is amazing. I even tell her to go talk to another guy and point to one and she says \"no I wanna talk to you, I'm really picky.\"\nBefore she leaves she tells me I'm rude but a great dancer with a wink. \n I woke up feeling like a piece of shit and haven't told my girlfriend yet. I cancelled plans to see her because I can't face her. My girlfriend is extremely loyal and overall awesome girl. She doesn't deserve to be cheated on. \n Here's where I need advice. I'm aware I'm a fucking asshole fuck face for what I'm done. I swear I really liked my girlfriend before all this, it's really rare for me to be attracted to a girl in more ways than physical. She's the first girl in a long time I want to date rather than just hook up. But this morning I woke up not really liking her anymore she's done nothing wrong too. I really enjoy spending time with her. She's extremely beautiful, sex is great and really likes me.\nI don't know if it's my guilt for what I've done or if I actually really like the girl at the club. \n Am I too immature for a relationship right now ?

{"input_text": "Railroad Consultant Here: \n When  Continuously Welded Rail  (CWR) is laid, they heat the rail up to a certain temperature before fastening it to the crossties.  This temperature is known as the  Rail Neutral Temperature , or RNT.  The standard RNT across the majority of the US is 90 degrees fahrenheit, though some places will have a higher temperature because of excessive summer heat.  Believe it or not, there is little way to calculate the best RNT until after rail breaks and engineers can use formulas to calculate how to fix the rail. \n The idea is to keep the rail in tension as much as possible (when rail is less than 90 degrees in temperature).  Since steel rails can handle tension better than compression and because extreme tension (in excess of 200,000#) will simply cause the rail to break (a much more minor issue), severing the track signal circuit and alerting the train crews that they may not proceed, the railroads lay them to maintain tension.  When the track buckles, as in the photo, the signal system will not detect it since it usually does not actually break the continuous circuit.  In times of extreme heat, railroads forbid trains from exceeding 20 mph (restricted speed) so that they will have a better chance to see this type of deformation in time to stop the train before derailing. \n Why did the track buckle?  Since rails in sun can exceed 140 degrees fahrenheit, a difference of 50 degrees above the rail neutral temperature is encountered by the rails.  CWR also features rails which can exceed miles in length, so compound heat expansion over such a long distance, and there are some serious compressive forces in play.  Rail under these conditions has two options: go up or turn into a squiggle.  The subject track seems to have chosen the latter. \n Why one set of tracks and not the other two?  Could be a manner of fewer [expansion joints]( or the fact that the rail is affixed to the concrete ties with a less rigid [rail clips](  It is also possible that the rail was laid recently and not properly [tamped](  The ballast under the damaged track looks cleaner, thus it was likely laid more recently.

{"input_text": "I actually lived right near Houston and I have been to all the regionals in that area for the past few years. It's the one at Gunspoint, right? \n It's run by DNA, and it's in a big empty mall store basically. In the past, the regionals in that area have always had a turnout of 350-450, so expect to be there all day. It's a fucking gauntlet, let me tell you. Keep your shit with you at all times, people will not hesitate to rob you if you aren't paying attention. Since this is your first regionals, get there early, like around 9AM. Find an official and ask him for a Cossy ID. You need one of these to compete and it registers you with Konami for all other official events. They sometimes run out of these, so you really need to do this. You get a nifty card and everything. Second, DNA is shit at organization, the tournament will probably not actually start until 11:30 even though they say they'll start at 10. You'll also need to get a decklist form and tournament registration slip. You need a Cossy ID to fill these out completely, so again, get on that. Those two things are basically what they sound like. It is also $20 to enter the tournament, but you also get 5 packs of the most recent pack. When the tournament actually starts, they'll post all the match lists on the wall. You just find your name and go to the corresponding table. Around 30 minutes in, a judge will come around and drop a results sheet between you. You fill out who won and sign and call a judge when you're done. You'll most likely be done before time, but if you aren't a judge will come over and call 5 turns. The turn player at that point becomes turn 0, and you count up to 5 turns, and at the end of the 5th turn the player with the most lifepoints wins that round. Also, you will most likely be done with your match before the official time for that match ends, so you'll be doing a lot of sitting around waiting, so bring entertainment if you can't find anyone to play a friendly match with or trade. If you're going to be alone there, try not to leave the regional area for the rest of the mall in between rounds. I called Greenspoint Gunspoint earlier for a reason. It's also depressing as fuck, half the shops are closed and you're likely to be harassed by the wannabe gangsters milling around. Don't take that as something you should be worried about, you'll be fine if you just stay in the regional area. \n As for the decks you will see, since it's going to be a big regional, you're going to see a lot of decks there. The first few rounds you probably won't see many of the big meta decks, but don't expect to not see them. The top tables are likely to be full of them, and the more wins you get the more likely you are to see them. I would probably wager that you will see a lot of Wind-Up and Mermail variants. I wouldn't count Fire Fists out either. KEEP IN MIND, most of these decks are prepared to counter other meta decks. Their whole side deck is based around what they plan to play against. Therefore, if you run a fairly consistent, yet still powerful deck, you can do well solely based on the fact that people will not be prepared for it. I had a friend top with Dragunities way back before the structure deck came out when no one was prepared for a Hidden Arsenal archetype doing well. I would run Chaos Agents were I you, but the deck types you listed aren't the best currently tbh. Still, regional tournaments are very fun and it's great to be with a ton of people who share your same hobby. Plus if you have some decent cards on you, you can sell some for inflated prices and make some dosh. There are no shortage of unprepared people looking for that last staple. [summary]: "}

A year later, I was promoted again to $70K and $11K anual bonus. After a few months I was laid off as part of a major company re-org.

I was very active in building credit as soon as I could, I am proud of my 802 credit score. \n Important note: Despite not having a full-time job, my wife has a \"fellowship\" which luckily pays $900 a month.

My brother decided to stick around and watch it with me, and he doesn't watch wrestling. He used to watch WWE nearly a decade ago, but very casually.

The entrance was fantastic, the camera work, the lighting. Absolutely brilliant. And the match was just as good. My brother marked out for the top rope stomp, I was just enjoying the perfect pacing and delivery. An incredible match. \n \n Women's Fatal Four Way. I was honestly surprised not only to see a women's match that went over 5 minutes, but was also pay-per-view quality (and probably better than the first two matches on the card). My brother didn't seem to interested, said something about Bayley having a nice butt. I agreed. Really refreshing to see this caliber of wrestling in women's matches, and just really reminded me how absolutely awful women's wrestling is on the main show. \n \n Owens vs Zayn. I thought the pacing of this match was just a tad too slow in the beginning, despite knowing it was necessary. My brother lost interest and left in the first 10 minutes. I thought the rest of the match had some great storytelling and Zayn sold like a champ. \n \n \n &nbsp; \n As a final note, the commentary is also leagues better than what we get in WWE.

{"input_text": "This isn't exactly true either, because scale and infrastructure costs are relative.  What matters more than anything is population  density  and population  distribution .  For example, the U.S. is many times larger than Romania and has over ten times its population, but has only about a third the population density (~90 versus ~250).  On the other hand, if we take a convenient state (let's use Florida) we find that it has a similar population to Romania but significantly  less  land mass, indicating that the U.S. population is not at all evenly distributed on a national level (or, it turns out, throughout individual states).  As for Romania, it turns out that it has a surprisingly even population distribution, with significant cities spaced almost evenly throughout the country.  From a whole-country IT infrastructure perspective, that's a dream come true. \n What this  should  be telling us is that (federal BS aside) the U.S. should have drastically varying internet speeds depending on where you live.  If you live in high population density states or large cities, there's little meaningful reason you shouldn't be seeing speeds similar to Romania.  (Remember, trunk and distribution lines are expensive, but they're practically a line item compared to the costs of last-mile infrastructure.)  Instead, U.S. internet has far  less  variance than would be expected given the situation, a much lower \"high end,\" and aggressive overselling practices on the part of ISPs that have caused all sorts of other issues.  In spite of this, U.S. ISPs constantly complain that they're not making enough money (while posting record profits), demand further accommodations from multiple levels of government, and generally do anything they possibly can to squeeze an extra few dollars out of the consumer.  (This setting aside the various tacit agreements between providers on non-competition, general pricing etc.) \n A common response to this is that one reason the large ISPs are charging what they do and setting up the way they do is that they have to bear the additional costs of covering rural areas where infrastructure costs often outweigh revenues.  This is bullshit.  First, these companies are not short of working capital, so financing does not present a major barrier to infrastructure expansion/improvement.  Second, they've received major government subsidies (actual money, tax breaks, regulatory changes etc.) to serve rural areas, which should have mostly offset the additional expenses.  The only real exception to this would be conditional exclusivity agreements, since that's pretty much what they're  supposed  to do. \n For the 80+% of U.S. internet customers who are non-rural, the current situation has nothing whatsoever to do with scale or technology and everything to do with oligopoly and regulatory capture.

We would always sit next to each other at the bar, and even did a karaoke duet together.  Because of this and my friends telling me to do so, I decided I would ask her out. \n I didn't have her number at the time, but I knew that she worked at a coffee shop.  I went to her coffee shop and she was surprised and excited to see me.  I ended up asking her out, her response was \"I'm pretty busy this week, but I'll give you my number and let you know.\"  Obviously this was not what I was hoping to hear, but I stayed optimistic.  The next day she texted me and said \"So, I'm willing to go to dinner with you, but I'm seeing someone right now, so it would only be as friends.  Mad props though for asking me out, that was really impressive.\"  I responded \"Thanks for the honesty, I appreciate it, but we probably shouldn't do dinner, considering my intentions.\"  And that was that. \n We have hung out since in a group setting, and it's totally comfortable.  We still talk alot and have done karaoke duets, and my friends tell me that she still seems into me, although being burnt once makes me find holes in that argument that probably aren't there. \n Last night I was hanging out with one of my friends and he informed me that she had stopped seeing the guy.  I was kinda excited and bummed out to hear this.  Mostly bummed because she hadn't made it known to me in any way, even though we had seen each other since she had stopped seeing him.  My friend told me that it's not a big deal because she has almost no experience with guys (never been in a relationship, first kiss was at 23 or so) so she wouldn't really know how to communicate that to me. \n I've basically decided that I am going to ask her out tonight if she hangs out with me and my friends.  I'm going to be a little less direct than last time, and tell her that my buddy is playing a show tomorrow night, and would she like to come with me.  I need to do this now, because she is a beautiful girl who is a barista, she WILL get asked out sooner rather than later. \n So, now we get to my original question, is she going to see this as creepy and me keeping tabs on her until I could ask her out, or will she see it as me really liking her and pursuing her because I think she's worth it?

{"input_text": "I graduated with my bachelor\u2019s degree a few weeks ago and started work as a part-time receptionist to bridge the summer between undergrad and graduate school. I\u2019m set to go to the same university for my master\u2019s degree, but now I\u2019m starting to wonder if I should take a year off and apply elsewhere because of what happened last night. \n My boss invited me to this cookout party at her house. It was mostly her coworkers, but also a few friends, and one of her friends happened to be\u2026 my former professor. Because we knew each other, and because pretty much everyone else at the party was way too drunk, we ended up talking. \n Now, we never had any sort of relationship during my undergrad.  At all.  I only had him for one class for both semesters of my senior year, and because teachers frighten me (I had a really bad experience in high school) I don\u2019t look them in the eye or talk to them unless absolutely required. I wouldn\u2019t even say we are friends or in a mentoring relationship. \n I do think he is attractive in that gruff older professor sort of way, so it\u2019s not like I\u2019m completely adverse to him, and being outside of an academic setting did help, because it was easier to talk to him (I think it was the first time I talked to him directly about something other than school). And well\u2026 I don\u2019t like alcohol and I had only sipped it at that point, but my boss found this fruity drink I can\u2019t remember the name of that tasted so good to me that I had a little too much and got\u2026 hammered. I became blackout drunk for the first time in my life. The last thing I remember is talking to my professor, and then just flashes of intoxicated flirting from both sides, and then nothing. \n When I woke up this morning I was in my professor\u2019s bed. I almost screamed, because I\u2019d never even kissed a guy before, and we clearly had sex because we were naked, there was blood and dry semen on my inner thighs, and he had his arm around me. Not how I expected my Saturday to start. \n At that point I flipped out and dressed in what clothes I could find, grabbed my purse, and ran out the door. I did hear him call out to me as I was running down the street, but I was just so shocked at what happened that I left in a rush. When I turned the corner I realized I had forgotten to put on my shoes or underwear, and the shirt I was wearing was actually his, but I didn\u2019t go back. I got on my phone, turned on GPS and walked home. I didn\u2019t really regain my wits until a few hours ago, because what just happened has probably changed the course of my life. \n Not only am I getting an MA in the same subject as undergrad, but my former professor will be my future professor for one of my classes in the fall that I can\u2019t switch out of! I\u2019ll also likely have him for a few classes afterwards. At this point I\u2019m wondering if I should drop out before the term begins and try to apply to a different school next year, or just tough it out. I\u2019m torn. I\u2019ve never been in any kind of relationship before (I\u2019ve always been so awkward) so I don\u2019t really know how what happened would affect my education, if at all. [summary]: "}

{"input_text": "First FR in a long time, so I'll give a little background. Never was good with girls, so around Christmastime I decided to change that. Found this place, found some good material, had some good success. Then me and my roommate bought a bong. Fuck. \n Knew I had to get back to being social instead of smoking, and the two months I worked in Europe this summer were a perfect opportunity. Pushed myself a bunch and by the end strung together five straight nights of just going out and opening. Helped a lot. Hadn't practiced much game since getting back two weeks ago, but last night I'm sitting around watching RSD videos when my friend (let's call him Ryan) texts me about going to this country bar. I get a bit of hesitation and fear (bad habits die hard) but having just seen Tyler blow through being completely out of state and pick up anyways I'm inspired. Let's do this. \n He arrives with another guy I've met briefly (Joe) and we head to Joe's place to predrink. I'm pretty out of it having sat in the basement for two hours after the gym so this is a good opportunity to loosen up and get into the right headspace. Plus I fucking hate country, so being sober is out of the question. We get to the place and Ryan helps us blow past the $8 cover by namedropping the manager and a nonexistent student group we supposedly represent. One of Tyler's lessons that really struck me is that the tone of your night can be decided by the first 30 seconds, so as we head to grab drinks I make sure to make a couple wisecracks at the hot bartender and get her laughing. Bar is pretty empty at this point, so we post up at a table, chat with a bouncer and shoot the shit for a while. \n Place starts to fill up, I've got a good buzz on and am feeling pretty great. See two girls standing next to the empty dance floor and figure that's as good a first set as any, so I take off from my buddies, walk up and ask them \"hey, what's your favorite kind of cereal?\" Gets a good reaction and allows me to tease them and throw in some cold reads (\"Cheerios? Really? Let me guess, you're the boring one and she had to drag you out here tonight\"). Banter with them for a bit to get the blood pumping, then eject as the convo is dying down. Walking back to my friends I realize I could have kinoed more and should have left them a little earlier, before the convo started to drag. Lesson learned. \n There are some people on the dancefloor now and Ryan and Joe are getting antsy, so we go check things out. There are two girls dancing with no guys and Ryan tells me to go open the Asian one (HB7, same as her friend). I comment on her impressive ability to dance in heels and hit it off with both of them. My boys come up and the Asian recognizes Ryan. Says they went to the same spot in Mexico on vacation and pulls out fucking Facebook pics to prove it. Small world. He ends up with her while I'm chatting up the friend. Get the boyfriend line dropped on me after a while, I basically talk past it but she heads to the bathroom (We see them later, I chat with the friend for a while longer with great eye contact and rapport but she's not so receptive to kino and plays the boyfriend card again. What can ya do.). Ryan is still doing good so me and Joe decide to go find our own show. \n Throughout the night there are various sets I open that are just short interactions or blowouts, so I won't get into all of them. At this point I'm feeling great, we're just cruising around talking to chicks and planting seeds with whoever we can. I'm doing all the opening (probably about 12-15 sets in total this night) and Joe tells me \"man you should keep opening for us, you're good at this!\" Never had anyone tell me that before and it would have been unthinkable two or three months back. Feels good man. \n We head outside for a smoke and as soon as we light up I spot two girls, HB7.5 brunette and her HB8 blonde friend. I open the brunette by telling her I love her shiny ring-Sauron finger-thing on her hand and we fly into a great set. Tons of kino, tons of eye contact and the attraction is building fast. I'm sitting next to the brunette getting loads of kino in and we end up talking about Reddit of all things. She asks me \"when does the narwhal bacon\" for fuck's sake. Eventually they bounce inside and we're still smoking. We meet them later on the dancefloor but then I get distracted by some bullshit with Ryan and lose the set (I was also pretty drunk by that point). Fuck. \n This is long as fuck now, but there was one other set worth mentioning. I'm dancing and this HB6 is checking me out. We lock eyes and I go for it. Get my boys in with the whole group and we're doing good. Her friend comes up to me, grabs me and tells me it's another girl's birthday so I should kiss her. Birthday girl is like a 4, but I say fuck it, make a quick pass that comes to nothing. Still funny and I'm laughing my ass off. Flirt with the group, dance and talk with HB6 a bunch and she's actually a pretty cool chick. #close her and bounce with my boys. I actually run into this group again in the parking lot and they're trying to drag me into their cab to hit another club but I'm burnt, broke and my boys are leaving. Ryan K- and #-closed his Asian girl, so props to him. \n Things I did right: \n \n in a great mood all night, giving love and demonstrating value passively. Positive vibes go a long way. \n \n good openers to inject humor into the convo instantly or just to dive right in without a hitch. High confidence paid off. \n \n good body language \n \n lots of kino, almost all executed very naturally \n \n \n Things to improve on: \n \n injecting sexuality into the conversation and turning it towards sex. I didn't realize this until I was home, but combined with the amount of kino I was doing I think this could have been pretty clutch. I have a fair idea of how to pull this off but tips and suggestions are welcome. \n \n leading and isolating. Again, didn't realize this until the end of the night but it would really have been key. If I could have isolated one of the smoke pit girls, especially the brunette, I would have been golden. [summary]: "}

I saw him last weekend; he dropped me off before going to see his mum, but then I didn't hear from him. I dropped him a quick message to ask how his day went the next day, and nothing. He'd read the message though which is completely unusual. \n Eventually I sent him another one basically saying that if things had changed for him, I felt that I deserved a bit more than just being ignored; at least an explanation or something. He responded that night apologising for blanking me and saying he was an asshole, but some shit has hit the fan in his life and he's not really known how to deal with it. \n I said that I understood, but also mentioned that I'd been a bit upset after being left to wonder what was going on. He said (again after a long wait) that he was so sorry and that he knew it was upsetting, but he just needs a few days to pull himself together. \n I'm really confused. I know on the surface it seems simple enough, but I can't help wondering what's going on and if I'm actually going to hear from him at all. He hasn't said whether it's family stuff or anything (although I did stop hearing from him after his mum had asked to see him). \n Men, as a socially confident and outgoing guy having been with a girl you really clicked with for a short while, would you say this if you had just randomly decided that you didn't want to see the girl any more? Or do you think this is genuinely a case of him being upset and that he'll get back in touch soon? [summary]: "}

Islamic countries have the rare situation of being in unstable regions that have classically been prime strategic targets for global powers (and hence the reason why these countries are unstable).... \n Islamic terrorists aren't committing these atrocities because they are genuinely offended by a few cartoons, they commit these atrocities because they want to turn the global powers against muslims. That way they can say \"look, the west hates you, join our cause and stand against them\". They want to start an anti-west uprising in the middle east, they want Europe to condemn Islamic countries, they want the middle east to be more unstable. Why?

{"input_text": "Hi folks - I'm not sure if I'm looking for something that doesn't exist, but here goes: \n In the past, I've played and enjoyed MMORPGs that are similar to games like World of Warcraft (although I've never played WoW specifically). Most of these MMORPGs feature a high level of character customization - you can create any class (and sometimes race) with a wide range of available skill specializations - and they only require you to manage gameplay and gear for a single character (of course, it's possible to create multiple characters to be played at different times). The story and grind are fairly fluid and open; there are large worlds where grinding for a little extra XP / gear can be performed on randomly generated mobs, but there are also diverse quests available that can give XP / gear but also develop your character in a roleplaying sense. It's important to note that in most MMORPGs, these various quests are not strictly required, and characters are not forced to follow an overarching storyline. In fact, while there may be large and important boss battles in quest arcs or in the open world, there isn't usually a set storyline at all. \n This contrasts with many single player RPGs, which often involve party gameplay with companions or henchmen, requiring the solo player to manage multiple characters' gear and actions (e.g. Dragon Age). Many of those companions are also fixed characters in the storyline, rather than highly customizable, so they contain very little replay value during multiple playthroughs. Single player RPGs are often oriented toward a main storyline of some sort, which can give them the feel of being forced to run from this quest to that quest in order to eventually beat the game. One might suspect that \"railroaded\" single player games like this would at least compensate by having a compelling storyline (e.g. Final Fantasy Tactics and its remake), but not all of them do (e.g. Diablo 3... fun gameplay, but I wouldn't call its character development \"complex\"). I have enjoyed many of these single player games, but they also don't tend to hold my attention for long; I find them lacking in replay value, and they don't have some of the game design features of MMORPGs that I mentioned above. \n Here's the quandary : I like the design and game flow of MMORPGs as I mentioned above, but I don't want a game that is actually \"MMO\" or even required to be online at all. Think of it as a single player version of WoW, roughly speaking. I realize that many parts of MMORPGs are intentionally set up to bring players together in large parties, but a healthy portion of most MMOs can actually be experienced solo as well. My goal is to stay away from the expensive nature of modern MMORPGs in terms of time and money; online games with other players cannot easily be \"paused\" or saved/quit when real world responsibilities call, and especially in MMORPGs with PvP combat, the pressure to sink money into the game can be quite high (even more of a problem for folks who are gainfully employed and have money to spare). \"Just play an MMO but don't team up with anyone and try not to care about gear\" isn't a viable option in my book; it's difficult not to get caught up in gameplay with others when every town is filled with other players.

{"input_text": "What I was thinking in response to all the issues with runing, is to not increase drop rates or anything of the sort, but just make things a little bit easier to move around. Though the unique slots of SPD, CR, CD, RES, ACC would remain the same, and flat ATK, DEF, and HP also remain the same, I wanted to address some tweaks to the 2/4/6 DEF% ATK% HP% runes, and flat runes. \n I know it was probably unintentional that CD is the singular most important rune for (4) for any attacker. This means that ATK%  on (4) is much much less useful than ATK% on (6). Even DEF% has a bit of a similar problem for DEF-based attackers though much less so since people build tanky monsters. \n Excepting Anavel, Bombers, Mihyang, and possibly a few I'm missing, ATK% on (4) is pretty disheartening to get. What I'm proposing is that %-based runes for ATK, DEF, HP are generic and can fit the (2), (4), OR (6) slot.  So a sweet (4) ATK% rune with CR, CD, SPD subs would no longer mean you groan and wish it were on (2) or (6). You would just stick it there.   Didn't quite know this was going to make a CD vs CR vs ATK discussion, but I would love some feedback on the idea itself. \n Likewise, I would propose that flat stat runes just be (1), (3), and (5), so what would previously be a flat stat ATK rune on (6) with amazing subs, would actually just be a generic flat stat ATK rune and be placed where it usually goes, namely (1). \n I think it doesn't change the drop rate at all, but it really gets rid of the idea that a rune isn't usable simply because it was for the wrong slot. I know it may be a terrible idea, but I thought it might be a decent way to reduce the mind-numbing sadness that is rune farming. If this were to be implemented however, I would miss all those shitposts about flat stat runes. \n Please keep the discussion constructive as I just thought of this randomly and it's is most definitely not fleshed out.

Feeling cocky with my friends, we wanted to try one of the more difficult black diamonds. I started going down, and noticed that it was indeed the crunchy ice, and I had no traction going around a curve. Seeing this, I decided it would be better to wipe out and break my fall with a small tree, so I could start over again. I did that, and it worked surprisingly well,other than a small crash into the tree. However, my skis popped off. One of the stomps was broken,and to get the ski on, I would have to manually snap in. I couldn't get the skis on because it was way too steep, and at this point, I'm straddling this pathetic little tree for dear life. Then, a sudden idea hit me:I could just hold my stuff and butt-sled it. Sure, I'd look like an idiot, but at least I'd make it down. \nSo, I start butt-sledding a black diamond in Colorado (seriously, wtf), and all is going just peachy until I see there is another sharp-ish turn. I see this and start to panic. If I did not make the turn, I would fall off the run onto a steep, heavily wooded incline where I would most likely roll into some trees, shatter some bones, hit my head and die. When flying down a mountain on your ass, turning is a hard thing to do. As this hits me, I start frantically digging my heels into the snow, as I skidded towards the edge. However, as I earlier stated, this snow has no traction, and my boots were not stopping me. As I realized this, I reached some sort of strange contentment, like \"Well, this must be how it ends. It's nice to know that.\" At the last second, my feet hit some sort of rock or big ice chunk, and I stopped abruptly. For a second, I laid there and looked at the sky, and just laughed my sorry ass off. Easily the scariest moment of my life. [summary]: "}

First of all I'm going to gamestop and I wanted to know from others who have dove there if most of the stuff would be in bags or loose and, if they are in bags, what is the safest, most hygienic, and cleanest way to get in the bags.

{"input_text": "It's Week 2. \n There's a lot of negativity and paranoia flying around right now and I'd love to quell some of that, or at least try. \n So first, breathe in... hold it... and exhale... \n It's Week 2. \n First of all, Pettigrew. He's not Jimmy Graham. He's not Rob Gronkowski. He's not Tony Gonzalez. He doesn't have Peyton Manning. He doesn't have Tom Brady. He doesn't have Drew Brees. He's not great, but he's not bad. He's useful to the team and sometimes makes mistakes. Let's try not to throw his neck into a wood chipper. It's important to be critical, but not with such bloodlust. \n Schwartz. Yes, him going is a possible solution which might bring good results, depending on his replacement. We've also got some issues with injuries and other coordinators, too (for example: the secondary has made the same mistakes while covering receivers for the last 5 years or so, regardless of personnel). It's also a very long off-season, which makes it difficult to learn things and adapt to mistakes when you're so often  not  in a position to correct mistakes. You can only do so much off the field. You've got to be able to go back onto the field during the regular season and correct mistakes then. There is no other way. It's hard adapting in the NFL. The Lions could do better, but so could a lot of teams. Let Schwartz work,  because it's Week 2 . \n Akers. We knew he wasn't gonna be fantastic. We knew he wasn't gonna be Hanson. We knew Jason Hanson was going to retire some day, because even  the greatest players  have to retire at some point. Kickalicious  was not  a better option. I love the guy and think he  could potentially  be great in the NFL some day, but it's too much of a risk. Professional players that have been playing for a long time are better at protecting themselves. All it takes is one one for Havard to be injured for life. Hell, maybe all it takes is one major injury for Havard to assess his life and think, \"I was just kicking footballs around for fun. Do I really want to deal with this?\" and walk away. \n It's Week 2. \n Arizona is a tough team, make no mistake. Plus, we're going on the road and three time zones up. We've historically been terrible on the West Coast. Simple fact. The only exception is Oakland two years ago, and we had to score 14 points in the last 7 minutes or so to win. Also needed a blocked FG at the end. \n Teams make mistakes. Sometimes teams don't win. WE'RE NOT THE BEST TEAM IN THE LEAGUE, NOR WILL WE BE. It's simple! You have to either have a long-standing history of  consistency  and a great front office (Green Bay, New England) or have one of the best quarterbacks of all-time on your team - these QBs being the best because they're efficient leaders; everyone on the team plays better with them (Brees, P. Manning, Rodgers). \n And it's Week 2. The Giants are 0-2. The Vikings are 0-2. How do you think the Panthers feel at 0-2 given the nature of their losses? \n There are only three 2-0 teams ion our conference. That means we're tied for 4th. \n And, oh, one more thing.  It's Week 2. \n Manage your expectations! Go watch soccer, go watch Cardiff struggle game in and game out because they're nowhere near the quality team that Man United, Tottenham, Chelsea, Everton, Swansea, Arsenal, Stoke, City, and others are. Anything can happen in the NFL. Any team can do great. Relax and let it happen! \n You  have  to be patient, you  have  to manage your expections, and most important, always trust and support the Detroit Lions. If you can't, they're not your team. GO LIONS. [summary]: "}

The closest we have to that is an agreement that we're partners, and will do everything we can to help each other grow and be happy. It's...great. \n We do, however, have one issue. I grew up believing in weddings and unicorns and Disney and all that. He...did...not. We're different in that respect. I'm touchy-feely. He...is...not. That extends into our personalities as well. I love him, I told him that. He doesn't love me, but says that the reason is that he doesn't know what love is, and he might, but doesn't know.

{"input_text": "Services (or commands + handlers, if you want to go that route) should be completely self contained. The service's clients should only have to make a single method call to tell the service to do something. The rest should be up to the service. So, option B in your example. \n If your service expires projects, then that probably means something along the lines of checking the date and updating something in the database. The clients of the service shouldn't have to worry about that second part. Just  tell  the service to do its thing and done. \n Why? Because you -- more specifically, your service's clients -- shouldn't care that a service does its job now or later or how it accomplishes its work. Maybe expiring a project takes to long for a web request, so one implementation of  ProjectExpirationService  sticks something in the queue to do later. The queue consumer picks it up and uses another expiration service implementation to do its work. Option A in your example above doesn't let you do that. There's a coupling between the  specific implementation  of the service and whether or not a  save  call is needed later. That's extra cognitive overhead for whoever is working on the system as well as some additional complexity. On a small scale, no big deal. Multiply that times 5, 10 or 100 service objects and you're probably going to have a bad time. \n > I feel #A is much better for testing since I can test the service with just PHP objects, leaving the database alone. \n Not really. What's much better for testing is only having to mock a single dependency (the service) instead of two (sevice + repository). Then you can test your service by mocking the repository and probably run some integration tests with a real database backend on the repository. It's a chain: make sure each part works with fake objects until your objects start touching the outside world. When that happens add in some integration tests and finish things up with an end to end test or two that hits the entire stack (and probably only follows \"happy\" paths). [summary]: "}
